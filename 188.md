An elf came to see Zich's party while they were having dinner at their assigned dormitory. He was the one who was leading the elf's vigilante group that I met during the day.

The elf, who introduced herself as Deniel Myowen, greeted Leona and shared her name with the group. And sat down at the table.

“Would you like some?”

"Fine."

Daniel steadfastly refused Hans's invitation. It wasn't because I didn't like Zich and the others. It was just Daniel's personality.

“How are you  , Deniel?”

Leona speaks to him. Zich took a slice of bread and looked at the scene.

'It must be an elf with a face after all.'

They arrived in a rural village at the edge of an elven country, analogically.

No matter how different the status of an elf princess from a human princess was, it was strange that there was someone in a local village who could recognize the princess.

“It didn't go very well. It is the hope that the Lord Gong is running away.”

“Ugh. I’m sorry about that.”

“Before you apologize, I wanted you not to run away. Do you know how much I was worried about you and others because you left behind a letter?”

There was a slight crack in his stone-faced face. But it wasn't just disappointment and anger that was felt in the crack. Rather, he was much more worried about her.

“Still, there was no harvest! Look at this!"

Leona showed 'Tears of the Lake'. Daniel's eyes widened.

“Tears of the lake?”

“I’m here!”

Deniel looked at Lake's tears and Leona's face alternately.

“•••This is amazing. I really didn't expect you to come."

I thought it would be nice to come back only in good health, but you're really looking for stolen treasure.

"how! I am an elf who can do it if I try.”

“•••I will admit it. I really didn't expect to find the missing treasure."

“Ahem!”

Leona raised her head with a proud expression. However, as Deniel continued to speak, her chin, which had risen unaware that it was high in the sky, gradually descended.

“I heard that you stole some of the queen’s jewels, but I thought you would not be able to save a lot of money in the human world because you were scammed.”

“I thought that even the little money I saved would be wasted quickly because I spent a lot of money on buying a few cheap things.”

“Even if I found 'Tears of the Lake,' I wondered if I would be kicked out of a riot after being swayed by humans and unable to do this or that.”

“However, you will be able to bring back the treasures of the clan in such a wonderful way. You foolish Deniel, I have to apologize to the princess.”

Leona's chin, which had been raised so high, drooped down enough to worry that it would break through the ground.

Deniel's words were pierced like a dagger in her chest.

Deniel knew her reaction halfway through, but didn't stop talking. Rather, he pushed Leona by giving the accent to the accent.

“Then where shall we listen to the princess' saga? He must have gone to the human world and performed a great job, right? The perfect, brilliant, wonderful performance that you told me before.”

“Ugh… ”

Leona ruffled her hair. He was so shy that he wanted to find a mouse hole right away in the eyes of the other party who looked at him pathetic.

Deniel, who was riding on Leona without a change in expression, sighed.

“Well, looking at the reaction, you did everything I said. Or was it about to be beaten? Come to think of it, it was the princess who caused the loss of 'Tears of the Lake', right?”

That was the last blow. Leona shrugged and put her face on the table. Seeing the body twitch, it looked like it was stuck.

“It seems unlikely that a princess like this will find 'Tears of the Lake'.”

Daniel looked around the group.

“Perhaps you helped the princess, right?”

"Yes."

Zich nodded his head. A normal person would spit words of humility here, but Zich was not such a character.

“It seems that the princess is lucky as a person. After all, you’ve always been lucky.” Leona, lying face down, groaned again.

Daniel looked at Leona. Her hair is dripping all over the place and spilling onto the table.

he smiled It was a smile that was warm and sympathetic, and it was unbelievable for a person who had ever had a hard expression on his face.

He reached out and placed a hand on Leona's shoulder. Leona gently shook her head.

“The fight ends here. Welcome back, Princess.”

"•••Hehe! Nice to meet you too, Daniel!”

Leona jumped up with a helpless laugh.

“Did you catch the thief?”

I asked her just in case because she had brought back the 'tears of the lake'. However, the answer he returned was slightly different from his expectations.

“Killed it.”

Daniel looked at Leona. Her expression hardened a little. But it didn't seem like she was still hurting, at least she took it to heart.

“•••You have made a difficult decision.”

“Because I thought it was good for my first opponent. I still wanted to kill him.”

Daniel looked at Zich and the others.

As he knew, Leona was not the type of person who could say such a thing. I couldn't help but think that I was influenced by someone.

And the most likely suspect had no choice but to be Sina Zich and the others.

But he didn't say any more. Birds that leave the nest and go outside are inevitably influenced by the outside in some way.

Besides, for him as an elf warrior, Leona's change wasn't a bad change at least.

“If the princess has executed her own punishment, there is no need to talk about it anymore.”

So I just said that and ended the topic. Most of all, I didn't have time to get entangled with one insignificant thief.

“Then let me tell you about the current situation. Oh, before that, let me formally introduce myself.”

He straightened his posture and looked at Zich and the others.

“My name is Denis El Millowen, as I said before. Now I am the captain of the guard of this forest, Golven.”

“Captain of the guard?”

Leona widened her eyes.

“Why are you? What about the royal guards!”

'So I was friendly with Leona.'

One of Zich's questions has been resolved

Somehow, when an elf in the countryside said that he was too close to Leona, it seemed that he was a member of the Royal Guard.

He was probably the one who escorted Leona. However, the current position seemed very poor compared to the royal guards.

“Are you relegated? Because of Leona's run away."

Lyla guessed the cause.

"uh?"

Leona was surprised. I looked at Lyla who spoke, then looked at Daniel again.

“Gee, is it true, Deniel? Did you get cut off from the Royal Guard because of me?”

Daniel looked embarrassed.

Until now, Leona was a man who seemed rude to anyone who didn't know him, but he had to control it in a way that Leona wouldn't get hurt.

If he affirmed the present fact, Leona would definitely feel guilty.

But he could not lie, so he meekly affirmed.

“There is also a responsibility for not stopping the princess and the thief from getting along in advance. There were also things that did not prevent the extortion of 'Tears of the Lake'.”

Hearing the story, it was fortunate that it ended in relegation.

Leona was in tears. Because of you thoroughly, someone close to you has been harmed.

"I'll try to fix it somehow!"

Leona hit the table and shouted loudly.

"Fine. Obviously I didn't do my job properly... .”

“It happened because of me.”

Leona cut off Deniel's refusal. Daniel was surprised. Her mood suddenly changed.

It was Leona who was always bright and energetic, but immature. It was because she thought it was because of her young age and the people around her raised her too much.

But now her face was that of an adult who was taking responsibility for the damage she had caused.

“Of course, you won’t be able to get rid of the relegation right away. It's not going to make a fuss, and it won't work either. Still, since I've been looking for 'Tears of the Lake,' it will be a relief to some extent. And I will be responsible for my sins.”

"Princess."

“I shouted out loud, but it won’t be that easy. Still, at least I won't make the people who did it for me suffer because of me. So, just wait a minute.”

Even on a short trip, she learned a lot.

I came out of the human world and came to know the fear of the foolish self and the world.

However, fortunately, she met Zich and the others, and she had a chance to become more mature.

I saw Zich, who overcomes the incidents and accidents he encounters with his strong strength and great wisdom. And I listened to Zich's teachings to Hans and Snock.

Occasionally, Zich gave Leona direct advice. And Lyla, who was as strong and wise as Zich, took good care of her.

Having gained experience in that environment, Leona's horizons broadened and her thoughts deepened.

Really different. The immature Leona of the past and the current Leona are like different people.

'It seems that the princess's trip was very successful.'

Deniel felt a little, very little, thanks to the thief who became Leona's travel opportunity.

"all right. Wait. I’m not really looking forward to it.”

“In that case, even if it’s empty words, say that you expect it.”

Leona pursed her lips.

Daniel let out a small laugh. As it is, I wanted to have a small party to celebrate the growth of the princess. But that was not the case now.

Daniel smiled. And I changed my posture again.

Zich also stood up straight. Until now, it was a personal story between Leona and Deniel, but from now on, it was a foreboding that a serious story would begin.

'It must be about the tension in the village.'

“Actually, the reason I came here is not just because of relegation. It is also to guard against this place.”

"boundary? What boundaries?”

Leona asked.

“Isn’t this the first place humans have to go through to invade the kingdom? I pray that an elite member of the capital was also dispatched to prevent that. By the way, if I complete this mission well, it may not be immediately, but I think I may be able to return to work.”

“That’s a good thing. Are you suddenly wary of humans? why? Did you have any conflicts with humans? Could it be because of 'Tears of the Lake'?”

If so, Leona's face turned white because her fault had become the seed of a conflict between the races.

"no. This is just to be prepared for the unexpected. It has nothing to do with humans. Yes, with humans.”

'It's like a situation just before the war where the surrounding borders are tightened just in case.' With that in mind, Zich opened his mouth.

“Do you think there will be a war with other elves?”

"Yes?"

"what?"

The group was surprised. In particular, Leona's eyes widened so much that she was worried that they would pop out.

But Daniel sent out a light of deep admiration.

“You are amazing. I don't think you said a few words, but you get it right away."

“What do you mean, Daniel! Are you sure what Zich is saying?”

“Sorry, but yes. No, it’s worse than that.”

Deniel said, with a firmer face than before.

“The Iron Clan declared 'Puola'. The kings of the neighboring clans were summoned. Also, the contact between the His Majesty, the Queen, and the Maiden who went to 'Mentis' to participate in 'Puola' was cut off. You're probably caught."
