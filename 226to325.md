Zich looked at Lyla. It seems that Lyla was so engrossed in the magic item laid out before her eyes that she had not yet noticed that the owner of the store was Elena Dwayne.

Zich tapped Lyla on the shoulder. Lyla turned her head. The corners of her eyebrows are raised slightly as if she was annoyed by the interruption when she was in the throes of a shopping spree. Zich pointed to Elena with a chin.

Only then did Laila confirm the owner of the store. At first, he didn't seem to recognize him when he tilted his head.

'Do you have any memories of Elena Dwenyin?'

I thought he remembered Gren Jennard's party to a certain extent, but I guess he didn't. But soon after seeing his eyes wide open, it seems that he simply didn't notice it right away.

“There are many things, so take a look.”

Have you been a guest for a long time? She took out other objects from the inside and showed them. That's why he didn't see Lyla surprised to see her.

Lyla took a step back cautiously. And as if discussing whether to buy something or not, I took Zich and kept a distance.

"Right?"

" right."

Conversations come and go without any given or anything. However, just that alone, the two had no difficulty in sharing the meaning. Because the topic was already in common. And so that other people do not know the meaning of their words. No matter how sparsely populated, this place is a road. It's not a very good place to talk about their secrets directly.

Besides, they're a little far away, so Elena won't be able to hear them, but at least Hans and Snock's ears will catch their conversation perfectly.

Of course, the two of them were looking at the products in the store with a curious expression, not paying attention to Zich or Laila's conversation, but there is no convenient function to listen to what they want to hear and filter out what they don't want to hear unless the ear organ physically blocks them.

No matter how trustworthy the servants were, they could not teach them their secrets.

"surprised."

"So do i."

But when you think about it, it wasn't that strange.

Her talent and ability are so great that she was part of Gren Jennerd's party. To be honest, there are two beings who think Zich is better than Elena Dwayne before her return as a wizard. It was only the Demon King of Magic and Laila.

Of course, Lyla isn't quite as good as Elena Dwayne before her return.

If you look at the double chant as if you are drinking some cold soup with no chant, Lyla was overwhelmingly superior in talent, but Elena Dwayne before returning was probably Elena before returning, as Elena Dwayne had matured with a lot of experience and sufficient time. .

'It won't take long to catch up with that.'

Will you just catch up? It must have been that he would easily overtake and run to an unseen place.

“What are you going to do?”

“What if?”

Zich shrugged.

“I have no idea.”

After all, she is a different person now. And I also have a first-person relationship with Zich. What did you mean here?

“Then why don’t you make friends like everyone else?”

Obviously, they are referring to Rubella and Leona. When Zich made an impression, Lila smiled. Then he tapped Zich on the shoulder.

“Once we’ve decided, let’s move. As you said, we don't have to do anything."

It was time for Lila to move again to look at the store's items.

"Oh!"

Elena covered her mouth and looked somewhere. Her eyes fluttered in surprise.

''  That's it!"

"•••Yes?"

Snock was perplexed. Her two eyes were on him.

“That animal on your shoulder!”

“Ah, what is it?” Apparently, what she was interested in was knowing.

Snock was not surprised because he had experienced this kind of reaction quite a bit. Many people were interested in Knowwet because of his cute appearance.

Snock placed his hand in front of Now.

coup!

two

Knowwet climbed onto Snock's palm and said, "My family."

coo!

Nowet blew his nose happily. It looked very cute. But now, for Elena, the cuteness of Knowh was not the subject of judgment.

She pushed her excited face to the front of the know.

coup?

Now trembled. The sight of his face, much larger than his body, attacking with a strange sound of breathing, made even the world's knowledge terrified.

“This child is the return of the earth, isn’t it?”

Snock, the contractor, as well as Hans, who was next to him, and Zich and Lyla, who were approaching again, were astonished.

coup!

Nowet was surprised and hardened his body. I've met a lot of people so far, but no one knew that it was the return of the earth just by looking at Know.

“I saw it for the first time. I hope the day will come when I will be able to see the return of the earth with my own eyes!”

Looking at the glowing eyes, Knowwet's presence probably aroused her interest brilliantly.

“Is it okay if I do a little research on this child?”

coup?

Now, took a step back. It moved carefully from Snock's palm to his forearm.

"it's okay. Aren't you going to make me sick?"

But her words, which seemed insane at best and crazy at worst, seemed completely unconvincing.

woohoo!

Knowing felt fear and ran back to Snock's arm, then jumped over the fish bag and hid behind his back. He grabbed the hem of Snock's robe with his claws and hung it, then pushed his face over Snock's shoulder to warn Elena.

There was nowhere to be seen, such as the majesty of the return of the earth.

“No, don’t do anything really scary! No dissection or anything like that... !”

Even Snock took a step back. Nowt buried his face in the hem of Snock's robe.

"Please stop it. I know it’s strange, but the kids are so scared.”

It was Lyla who saved them. Snock and No Wet were moved by the reassuring appearance that stood in their way like a legendary warrior.

Elena bowed her head, knowing that she was too harsh.

“Sorry, I’m sorry. The rest is so strange... .”

“Anyway, you know it wasn’t the right attitude, right?”

I had nothing to say. Elena rolled her eyes. Looking at her, Lyla added a word.

“And you have to follow the rules. If there is a need to dissect the weeping and investigate it, I will do it.”

"•••Yes?"

Elena asks stupidly. And Snock and Knowtm, who were hit in the back by a trusted ally, hardened.

•••coup!

Only the faint cry showed the despair of Knowwet.

* * *

After a brief commotion, Elena started selling things again as the owner, and Laila picked things up as a guest.

Snock and Knowm moved away from them. Snock's chest was convex because of the wet that was hiding inside Snock's clothes. It wasn't a frightened look at the hem of his clothes trembling.

However, the two women who drove Snock and Knowt into shock and horror were only concerned with the product, whether fortunate or unhappy.

Lila picked up the closest item. The garbage I bought earlier... No, it was in the form of a plate similar to an artifact that had very, very, very low efficiency. However, the material was different.

“It’s iron.”

The guy called magic hides the ingredients very clearly. In addition, the more expensive and rare the metal, the better the magic permeates it. If there was such a thing as a magic god, Lila was sure that he would be a very luxurious person.

There are two reasons for putting out such iron artifacts under such conditions.

Like Laila, she was an extremely talented wizard, so she was out of the limit of materials to some extent, or she had no money.

And usually the latter performed poorly enough to assert that it was ineffective. But Lila looked at things carefully without prejudice.

' Huh?'

Lila was intrigued. I swept the magic circle engraved on the iron plate once. Usually, when it comes to magic circles, I think of a circle in which very complex lines and shapes are replaced.

It's not wrong. When Lyla created the artifacts, she put a lot of effort into engraving the magic circle.

However, the magic circle engraved on this iron plate was different. It was complicated, but not to the level people imagined.

But Lila never downplayed it. rather admired.

'Is the level high?'

Compared to the first golden version of the Artifact I bought, which inefficiently stacked all kinds of Jins, this could be said to be a piece of art.

'What is this?'

Feeling something dragging on the back of the iron plate that her fingertips touched, Lila turned the iron plate over.

“Hey!”

She admired the magic circle engraved on the back of the iron plate. He kept turning the iron plate over and checking the engraved magic circles.

“Anything interesting?”

"Look at this."

Lyla showed Zich the Artifact. Hans also showed interest. Snok shook his head.

Knowwem climbed onto Snock's head. However, the two never went beyond a certain radius of Lyla and Elena.

“Isn’t the magic circle above and below different?”

"Yes."

Hans looked at him curiously. But Jack's reaction was different. Even though he was ignorant of magic, he knew this much.

“Is it a three-dimensional magic circle?”

"right."

A magic circle that uses space beyond the plane to increase its efficiency. That was the three-dimensional magic circle.

“Of course, three-dimensional magic is nothing special. It's a three-dimensional magic circle that can barely hold out a business card. It's not that simple. But that alone doesn’t change the great thing.” Just as a sorcerer arouses people's admiration, just being able to draw a three-dimensional magic circle shows how high a magic achievement the wizard has achieved.

Zich looked at Elena. Hearing his praise, Elena's expression brightened. But at Lyla's next words, her expression hardened.

“Besides, I don’t feel any magical power. You did a really good job of concealing your magic.”

“I felt that too. Great magic concealment.”

As their conversation continued, Elena's expression darkened.

“Looking at the magic circle, it’s fire magic. It's not a big deal, but it's very efficient. In particular, engraving on such an iron plate is of a high standard.”

Lyla really liked Elena's artifacts.

Zich was also intrigued. It was the first time that Lyla had praised something like this. So far, Lyla's rating is 95 out of 100 , and the rest are okay.

“How much is this?” Lila immediately asked the price. Elena hesitated and said the price. Lyla's eyes widened.

"Yes? Is it that cheap?”

No, it's not cheap. This was nothing like me.

“I, that’s it… .”

It was when Elena opened her mouth carefully.

“Are you going to buy stuff there?”

The wizard from the store next door approached them. The store next door, which was so far away that conversations could not be heard, had already been cleaned up. It looked like it was time for work.

He clicked his tongue and said to them.

"I understand you're curious, but you don't need to buy that other thing, do you?"

And he said something shocking.

“What do you mean by buying things that are nothing more than imitations of artifacts made by a man who has no magic power and is not a wizard?”

(Continued on next page)

“… Isn't that an artifact?"

Lila rolled her eyes. Even as a woman, she could not have thought that this object was not an artifact.

The man made an impression. And Elena looked at me.

“Are you trying to cheat?”

"no! What are you talking about looking at me? I just missed the chance to speak! I was going to tell you now!” The wizard still looked suspicious. Jack intervened.

“This lady was trying to say something. Then you intervened. Judging from the circumstances, I think it is true that I was trying to tell the truth.”

"Is that so. That’s a good thing.”

It is genuinely relieved.

'I don't think I was bothering Elena or anything like that.'

It looked like he was really trying to give advice to Zich and his party.

'Still, there is no sign of ignoring Elena.'

“But, no matter how cheap they are, can you stop selling fake artifacts like that?”

“It’s none of your business.”

“Obviously I don't have the authority to do that. But I also want to tell you that as a mage belonging to the Tower, I have some thoughts.”

He looked at the iron plate that Lyla was holding.

“If there is talk of selling such useless things, the trust of Snuwick, Matoap, and even all the wizards here may fall to the ground.”

“If you add magic power, it will definitely activate! They are not useless!”

“How many wizards do you think can imbue iron with magic?”

“And even if that were the case, the efficiency would be atrocious.”

Elena couldn't answer the wizard's words.

The wizard sighed.

“It's true that I don't like you, but I don't want to bully you outright. But please know now that my thoughts are those of other wizards as well.”

And he looked at Zich's group.

“You showed me what you couldn’t see. You look like a traveler by looking at your outfit, I hope you can get something out of this city. Whether it be happiness, knowledge, or memories.”

Then he politely bowed his head and left.

For a moment, silence covered the audience. Lyla took the money out of her arms. And handed it to Elena.

Elena, who was depressed, blinked her eyes.

“Hey, what is this?”

“What is it? It's money. Did you say this price?”

“•••Are you really going to buy it?”

“Isn’t the store set up to sell?”

“Did you just hear about it?”

"Sure. I also have good ears.”

Lyla slightly brushed the side of her hair to show her ears.

But Elena still hesitated.

“What are you so worried about?”

said Jack.

“Just between that person and you, no, I don’t know what you are in this city right now, but that has nothing to do with us. You just said you were selling it, you put a price on it, and we're paying for it. I don't think you need to worry about this.”

Elena nodded her head. And he bowed his head towards Zich and Lyla.

“Thank you for your purchase.”

There was a slight smile on her face.

After shopping, Zich and his group set up a lodging. As they each had their own rooms, Snock embraced Nowe, as if running away from Lyla, and went downstairs into the room.

As Zich finished unpacking his room, he heard a knock.

It was Lyla. Zich sat across from her.

“Are you here for Elena Dwayne?”

That was the only reason she had come now.

" right."

Lyla asked in a slightly suspicious tone.

“Is that person really Elena Dwayne?”

“It looks right, isn’t it? Would you agree?”

"right. In my memory, that person must be Elena Dwayne.”

However, seeing Elena Dwayne in person was different from what she remembered, to the extent that Lyla immediately doubted that not only had she lost her memory, but that even the memories she barely had had been distorted.

"But she wasn't the Elena Dwayne we know."

"right."

Zich thought about the last time he saw Elena Dwayne before returning.

A mage with brown hair fluttering robes and holding a staff high by Rubella's side.

Each time the wand was swung, a ball of fire fell so hot that I thought it was really summoned from hell.

At that time, he was the strongest among Gren Jennerd's party in terms of single attack power. Besides, he had so much magical power that he was pouring out that formidable magic really nonstop.

'That guy is not a wizard, and he can't even use magic?'

Zich had no choice but to be engulfed in doubt.

“About Elena Dwayne’s past.

know?"

“No, I don’t know. When I found out about him, I was already at Gren Jennerd's party. Becoming an absurd wizard.”

“Then maybe there is no such thing as a proper teacher? Because of family circumstances or something.”

But Lyla shook her head to deny herself.

“No, it can’t be. In the future, if you are talented enough to be part of the Hero Party, there will be plenty of wizards who can educate you.”

“And his family is not a family that cannot teach magic. Rather the opposite.”

"the opposite?"

It seems that Lyla doesn't have that information.

“When I was the Demon King, the master’s name was Orland Dwayne.”

“•••Dwayne?”

Elena has the same last name. That means one thing.

“Are you family?”

“Father.”

Lyla opened her mouth.

“It was pretty popular. The Daughter of the Master Ma Thap is a member of the famous Brave Party.”

'By the way, Gren's colleagues were also of great status.'

Rubella, the saint of Carwiman, Leona, the princess of the elf clan, and Elena Dwayne, the daughter of Matapju.

'Was that Lara Browning the daughter of a noble noble?'

They were high-ranking colleagues, as if painted in a picture.

“If that’s true, then it’s probably not because of family circumstances that I didn’t learn magic. Oh, you should be more familiar with magic.”

“I asked the owner of the hostel a few things about this city. They said that the current mage's name is Wilwes Dwayne."

Another Dwayne

“What about your relationship with Elena Dwayne?”

“The present state of Matap, Wilwes Dwayne, has a son, and their name is Orland Dwayne.”

“Then you’re saying that Elena Dwayne is the granddaughter of the current Matthew and the daughter of the future Matthew?”

"maybe."

It's just not a good family. In the magical world, he would be able to wield authority that was no different from that of royalty beyond the nobility.

“It’s not that I didn’t learn magic because of family circumstances. So what about personal qualities?”

“It can’t be that.”

As someone who has dealt with Elena Dwayne, I can assure you.

“Isn’t it because your magic power is so great that you haven’t been able to move yet?”

Lyla already knew Zich's magic. Because of this, I doubted that Elena would be the same case. However, that opinion was also denied by Zich.

“My natural magic is comparable to that of a dragon. Even historically, it's worth mentioning. I, too, was able to use magical powers around the age of 20. No matter how much magic power Elena has, it cannot be compared to mine. If I had done my best, I would have already awakened the magic and would have left more.”

“What are you looking at like that?”

“No, nothing.” Once again, I felt like Zich's monster.

I remembered Zich, who had recently collided with a fire giant. Literally overturning lakes, carving mountains and scarring the ground.

'It's not called the Demon King for nothing.'

Leila trembled secretly. The notion that we shouldn't make Zich a Demon King became even stronger.

Ji-ke, who looked at Laila suspiciously, strained his eyes.

“Still, it looks like the house is going to be complicated.”

“Elena Dwayne? Do you think the family is big enough to make mattap wine from generation to generation?”

“Change your mind. He was doing business in a rare place while being ignored by others.”

"•••surely."

There seemed to be some problem.

“I’ll have to look into it in earnest from tomorrow.”

“Didn’t you say you didn’t care?”

“I have changed my mind.”

Zich licked his lips. Lila flinched. Zich's appearance now was that of a predator looking for prey.

“If Gren Gennard really has anything to do with hypocrites and robes, then there's a good chance he's doing something about Elena Dwayne as well. And now Elena Dwayne doesn't seem to be in a normal situation.”

“That’s  right.”

That's a reasonable opinion.

“Okay, I’ll help too.”

“Really?”

“Why are you so surprised? I told you. I will help you with your hobbies. After all, if the guys wearing robes were related, wouldn't you enjoy your hobbies with a lot of your taste?"

“It is.”

Zich giggled mischievously.

Seeing this, Lila immediately felt skeptical as to whether what she was doing was the right thing to do. But that too was short-lived.

“Let’s do it. I'm a woman who can do it too. What are you going to do?”

“Oh, you are very motivated. If I come like that, I have to match it too.”

Zich rubbed his hands and straightened his body.

“Now we need to gather information. That's why, Lila. Tomorrow at the tower

Let’s go.”

The two destinations have been decided.

Elena returned home. Her house in a luxury residence was the largest and most luxurious among the nearby houses.

It was hard to think of a house where a street vendor lived.

She was greeted by the employees who welcomed her home, and she entered the house. Inside was the money he had earned for the first time in his life. It's not much, but it's money for her dream. As if she had made a step forward, she was very excited.

But that feeling didn't last long.

“Is Elena here?”

she stopped walking I looked back to where the sound was coming from. An old man was coming down from the second floor.

“Oh, Grandpa. You came early.”

“If there are days like this, shouldn’t life be worth living? After all, people are just trying to pamper him with being a horseman. There is no such thing as caring for the elderly.”

He is Elena's grandfather and the most powerful person in the tower. And it was Wilwes Dwayne, a figure who could wield power like a king in this city.

Seeing the grumbling grandfather, Elena smiled bitterly.

Although he may be the best wizard of the Snuwick Tower, which is difficult for others to deal with, to Elena, he was a very generous grandfather.

“Have you eaten?”

“No, not yet.”

“Then let’s eat together after a long time.”

"•••Yes."

Elena nodded her head. The desire to say no was welling up in my throat, but I couldn't.

The two met at a restaurant. A sumptuous meal was laid out on the table. The two quietly made fun of the fork and knife.

“Where have you been today?”

Elena flinched. For a moment I thought I was going to lie, but I shook my head.

After all, if Wilworth investigates, he can't know his whereabouts.

Elena quietly talked about her work.

Wilwes was speechless. Did you just pass by?

However, Wilwes, who had been working diligently, stopped his dishes.

Elena noticed it too and glanced at him.

“It’s Elena.”

Wilwes sighed.

“Aren’t you going to stop now?”

The word will come again.

Elena wanted to cover her ears. However, he was unable to do so and was exposed defenselessly to his grandfather's worried words.

“You have no talent. Stop looking for another way.”

(Continued on next page)

that play!

The knife Elena was holding scratched the plate, making an annoying noise. It was as if her heart was screaming, she thought.

Wilwes licks his lips. He seemed to be contemplating whether he should keep talking like this, or if he should back down.

Elena hoped that Grandpa would never open his mouth again.

But her wish did not come true.

“I know your dreams. I know your talent. Your skill in assembling magic circles and chanting is enough to admire this grandfather.”

Said by the mage master and the greatest wizard in Snoowick.

“But it’s Elena. In the end, magic only works when you have magical power.”

Elena's talents from a young age were highly anticipated by those around her. It was only natural for her to fall in love with the magic that was fun, talented, and could even be praised by adults.

As she got older, her understanding of magic grew. Even more so because her circumstances as a wizard had been blessed.

The more it happened, the faster she wanted to use her own magic. Therefore, I tried to release the magic power as soon as possible.

However, even when her peers around her released her magic one by one, her magic was not released.

But the people around him were not so disappointed. No, on the contrary, there were a lot of people who were happy. It was because she thought that her innate magical power was so great that it was impossible to wake up easily.

People were talking about how great a magician would be if her magical talents and huge magic were combined.

Even if you don't know about the next generation, at least the next generation, or the next generation, was even rumored to have already been decided.

However, as time passed, Elena could not awaken her magical powers.

People with huge magical powers, as others expect, can hardly release their magic.

But it also has a degree.

Time passed day by day, and Elena's magic did not wake up.

At some point, the expectations around them were shattered. And it was filled with disappointment and a single shot instead.

In the end, people had no choice but to accept reality.

Elena has no magic power. For a child who dreams of becoming a wizard, the truth is no different than a death sentence.

All expectations were gone. People turned their attention to her.

And from then on. She began to hear from her grandfather, who she admired the most, to stop studying magic.

“If there is no magic power, magic cannot be activated. No matter how efficient and durable a water mill may be, it is of no use without running water.”

It is not rebuking, chasing, or soothing. A calm voice saying that it is just the truth. And for that reason, he was even more cruel to Elena.

“That’s why I banned your pocket money. In order to prevent you from buying things like magic books or magic materials anymore.”

Wilwes sighed.

“But you want to make money selling things that aren’t artifacts that you made.”

“… I won't cheat. And look, Grandpa! I made money too!”

She gave the money she earned today. Wilwes looks at some of the coins on the table. I couldn't really see it as a good line of sight.

“With something like that  … .”

“What about you, Dad?”

Suddenly, someone entered the table and interrupted Wilwess. Elena's face brightened.

"dad!"

“Are you here?”

"Yes. Long time no see, Dad. How was Elena?”

After the man bowed his head to Wilwess, he looked at Elena and smiled.

The man's name is Orland Dwayne. He was the son of Will Weiss and the father of Elena.

As a very promising wizard, he was also mentioned as a candidate for the next great magician.

“Have you eaten?”

“Yes, I have eaten.” He sat next to Wilwes, opposite Elena. He smiled and looked at Elena.

“You did an interesting job today.”

“Are there any rumors already?”

“Elena is famous in many ways, right?”

A fallen genius. It is something that the public can chew on very happily. Moreover, especially if the genius is a member of a prestigious family.

Elena bowed her head gloomy.

“You don't have to, daughter. I don't mean to mock you. As my older sister tells me, this father is on your side.”

“Khom!”

Wilwes groaned in displeasure.

“You keep doing it, so Elena can’t let go of her feelings.”

“Then how about it? Children should do what they want to do.”

“If that child has any magical powers, I would agree with your opinion, but Elena doesn’t have magical powers. Do you mean to throw a child into a torture chamber of hope that will never be reached?”

“As a wizard, didn’t I bloom too late? Elena can do it too.”

“Weren’t you still able to handle magic? That kid has no magic.”

“Not sure yet.”

“If you haven’t awakened your magical powers by that age, it’s not an exaggeration to say that it’s like the dragons in legend with a bit of exaggeration. Do you think that child's magic would be like that?"

“There's no law that says that's not possible. Besides, what's wrong with cheering a child on what they want?”

“The child’s future is at stake, such irresponsible… !”

Eventually, Wilwes, whose voice grew louder, stopped talking. Orland, who continued to refute Wilwes' words, looked at Elena.

“… I'll get up now that I've eaten it all."

Elena stood up. There was still more than half of the food left in her tableware. But neither Wilwess nor Orland caught her.

There was an awkward silence as she left. The rich man made eye contact and let out a long sigh.

Zich's group left Sokso and walked towards the horse tower.

Usually in cities like Hans and Snock, they often do not act like Sikra, who guarantees freedom, but this time they both followed Sieg and Lyla.

They also wanted to see the famous horse tower.

First, they stopped by Elena's store, where they bought the unfinished artifact yesterday. But the place where she had opened a store was empty. It didn't seem to come out today.

“Look at that! That’s a horse tower!”

coo!

As they stood in front of the tower, Snock and Knowem looked up at the tower, which stood as if it were piercing the sky, and admired it. Hans, who was next to him, looked at the tower and the wandering wizards.

“Let’s go in.”

Zich took the lead and led the party into the Ma Tower.

The inside of the tower was spacious. The first floor was open and there was no wall dividing the rooms. The pillars erected were supporting the tower.

There were people who seemed to be magicians roaming inside, but surprisingly there were also quite a few ordinary people.

It was probably like the people who came to see the horse tower, like Zich and the others. Unlike the Zich and his party, whose purpose was to gather information, their purpose must have been tourism.

“Where exactly is the tower?”

Hans asked Zich.

“There are many aspects, but the most fundamental is that it is a place where magicians gather for the development of magic.”

“Are you talking about the development of magic?”

“The number of pages is power, isn’t it? It's the same with wizards. Each of us is different in what we know and are good at, so if we exchange them and help each other, the level will be higher than if we did it alone.”

Zich stretched out his finger and pointed to the ceiling, that is, the top of the tower.

“Most of the towers are labs for wizards. The higher you go, the more skilled the wizard will be assigned. Of course, the atmospheric floor belongs to the matocrats.”

Hans and Snock looked up again.

“I think it will be difficult to climb.”

coup.

Snock talked about his feelings. Zich laughed bitterly.

“I don’t know about low- and middle-class wizards, but high-rise wizards should be able to use flying magic of course.”

"Oh, I see."

Zich and the party began to slowly tour the first floor of the tower .

“There are a lot of shops.”

“Because I’m tired of going out when I’m doing research. It would be nice to have a shop inside the tower like this.”

Lyla gave Hans the answer to this question. They are probably the same magicians, so I knew the psychology of the wizards in the tower.

Soon a staircase appeared in front of them. Zich read the inscription written on the floor.

“Up to the third floor is open. It’s for tourists.”

“It’s a little different from what we had in mind.”

As Snock spoke, Zich and Lyla laughed slightly.

“Magicians are people after all. I don't need money. No, I need a lot more money than the average person.” Zich's group looked around the 2nd and 3rd floors. On the 3rd floor, there was also a high-end restaurant where you can eat while looking outside.

Zich's party had a light meal there. The price was quite high.

After eating, the group left the store.

“Then, shall we start gathering information in earnest?”

Saying that, Zich started walking around the tower.

People who were not magicians belonging to the tower could not go up to more than the 4th floor, so the only places the party could go around were the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floors. Zich entered the nearest store. I bought a lot of stuff, got a crush on the store owner, and asked a question.

“Who is the master of this place?”

“Aren’t there any interesting stories?”

“Who are the famous wizards?”

“I heard that the son of Matthew is very good.”

Of course, that wasn't the only question. In order to avoid suspicion, I also included some irrelevant questions about Matop and Snuwick.

It was just the appearance of a tourist who was very interested in horse pagoda and snoowick.

However, no matter how spacious it is , you cannot get a lot of information from the shops on the 3rd floor.

I couldn't even go into all the stores and ask for it. No matter how you think about it, it was too bizarre.

'You don't have to do anything suspicious.'

After seeing the horse tower for a while, Zich went out.

There were also many shops around the tower. Even the wizards who hate to go outside the tower are not confined to the tower when they are doing research.

It was the shops around the tower that dealt with such wizards and tourists.

Zich also visited the stores and asked questions.

As the sun began to set and the crowds gradually disappeared, Zich stopped the barrage of questions.

"it's over?"

Lyla asked Zich.

“Roughly.”

“Did you get anything worth getting?”

“At least I got what the rumors deserve.”

“Then let’s go back.”

“Why are you bored?”

Lila shook her head.

"no. It was rather fun.”

It was the same with Hans and Snock.

Zich didn't just pretend to be a tourist when asking questions. I really did a tour of the tower.

In a way, I was confused as to whether this was a schedule to gather information or if it was really tourism.

“Okay then.”

They started heading home.

“But I was surprised at how he treated Elena Dwayne.”

He was able to understand how he was treated with Elena because he heard the information next to Lailado. Jack agreed.

“It was worse than I expected. A fallen genius from a prestigious family.”

Zich glanced around the tower.

“It’s not a position to welcome the victim.”

# No. 229 Tuesday

“Is it like you?”

When Lyla asks, I see Hans wince next to me.

Wasn't he one of the parties who vehemently harassed Zich, who was in the position of 'retreating the victim'?

I glanced at Zich's eyes, but he didn't respond.

“I don’t know. The information we have obtained so far is just information floating around. And even if that's the case, I don't want to sympathize with you."

“It would be even weirder if you said you were pitiful and helped her.”

“You know me well.”

When Zich smiled, Lyla showed a distasteful expression.

At that reaction, Zich laughed even louder.

“It seems to be true that Elena Dwayne could not unleash the magic from the rumors.”

Zich stopped laughing and said.

“By the way, didn’t you say that the amount of magical power that the young lady could never release until now was not enough?”

"okay. That doesn't mean the environment is bad, there must be some external factor.”

Lila's eyes twinkled.

“Do you smell it?”

“I’m not. The smell is very grassy.”

“But is there such a way? At least I don't know how to seal the magic without realizing it?"

If even Laila, who has a lot of knowledge, does not know, the method must be very rare. But because of that, Zich thought it was highly likely that the robes this time were involved.

“Think of the abilities of the demons created by those wearing robes. All of them are extremely rare. With that in mind, it wouldn't be strange to say that they have a way to seal their magic power without realizing it."

“That’s right. Where the hell do they get these things, y'know."

“There is one point where you have doubts.”

Zich and Lyla looked at each other.

“Cloone.”

The two voices overlapped.

Lyla nodded her head.

“In that mysterious ancient empire, even if it had such bizarre abilities, it wouldn’t hurt.”

“And those robes are the ones I think most likely have something to do with him.”

Lila blinks. Hans and Snock were next to them, so I used the name Gnome, but Lyla could easily identify who it was referring to.

'Gren Jennard.'

“Then you’re saying that he could have something to do with Cloone?”

“It’s just that it could be. But it's well worth the investigation."

“It would be nice if my memory was intact.”

Lyla lamented her memory of being punctured like a leaf eaten by an insect.

“There is no need to grab what you don’t have and get frustrated. It’s just useless.”

Zich spoke plainly, and this time he put information about Elena's grandfather, Wilwes Dwayne, into his mouth.

“Wilwes Dwenyne. They seem to have some really great names and achievements, but that's the kind of information we need.”

I didn't really wonder how great a human he was.

“The only thing to pay attention to is that he is against Elena Dwayne’s magic study.”

This is information that the owner of the clothing store inside the tower said with a low voice as if it were a secret story when they packed the clothes they bought with a smile.

“If you think about it, it was strange that a person from such a great family would open a store and do business. There was no sign that the daughter of a wealthy family opened the store out of hobbies and curiosity.”

In Lyla's eyes, it was clear that she wanted money. Jack agreed.

“When a rich daughter wants money, it means she can't use the money in her family. And that usually happens when you try to do something that has opposition in the house. To do what you want to do despite the opposition of the family, you will need money that is not related to the family.”

“Is it because of magic?”

“Perhaps Wilwes Dwayne is against Elena Dwayne’s useless study of magic, and Elena Dwayne is stubborn and wants to continue her study of magic on her own. It’s a conflict within a picturesque, rich family.”

You will find at least dozens of stories similar to this one among the stories floating around the market.

“Still, it will be difficult for me.” Lyla remembered that Elena was in a very depressed state when she handed her the unfinished artifact.

Next came Orland Dwayne, son of Willwes Dwayne and father of Elena Dwayne.

“Didn’t you say that he was a pretty famous person in the tower too? I heard that you are one of the strong candidates for the next big horse stock.”

“He is the one who will become the master of the tower in the future, so he must be showing off his prominence even now.”

But it wasn't his skill that Zich noticed.

“He wants to study magic with Elena Dwayne… .”

“Are you the father who lets his daughter do what she wants to do?”

There was a bit of sympathy in Lila's voice. Apparently, as she herself is a wizard, I liked Elena, who never gave up on the wizard even in the face of far-off trials, and Orland, who supported her, naturally felt good.

“It could be something like that.”

“Is there something wrong with the answer? Anything suspicious?”

“It’s a way of sealing the magic without even knowing it. Is it easy?”

It was a random question, but Lila faithfully responded to Zich's words.

“I don’t know because I don’t have the information, but I don’t think it’s an easy task.”

"right. In addition, if the target is the granddaughter of the master of the city, who possesses excellent skills and the highest power in the city, the difficulty will increase even more. However, if the opponent is a person who frequently encounters her, the difficulty is likely to decrease.”

"no way… .”

"right."

Zich's eyes shone sharply.

"I think Elena's family, Wilwes Dwayne or Orland Dwayne, is most likely the culprit."

Lyla didn't respond. It was because her brilliant brain thought that Zich's words had potential. I suddenly remembered Elena's face from when I sold the unfinished artifacts. It seemed that her face, which was selling things and smiling brightly, was covered with a dark shadow.

“… As you said, if one of the two is the culprit, who do you think it is?”

“I don’t know that yet.”

There were very few reasons to judge.

“Willwes Dwayne blocking Elena Dwayne’s dream or Orland Dwayne supporting her dream? I need to get some more information.”

“Will Willwe Dwayne be the most award-winning? Interrupted the dream of Elena Dwayne high  're there. "

“I don’t know. It's not that I don't understand Wilwes Dwayne's judgment. It's also the heart of a family to stop their granddaughter from going down the thorny path. It is common in this world for a person who thought he was on his side to hit the back of the head.”

Seeing so much, it was such a betrayal that Zich was not even impressed.

"But Orland Dwayne said they live separately, so we'll have to look into that."

“Did you say that Wilwes Dwayne is of a different school?”

As it was a tower where many wizards gathered, there was no choice but to create various groups within the tower.

Usually, the group was divided according to the characteristics of magic due to the nature of the tower, and there was no choice but to unknowingly compete.

And Wilwes Dwayne and Orland D Wayne were of different schools.

“Your father is the master of matap, but your son comes from a different school. If you think about it, it is also this injury.”

said Lyla.

“It would be good to know them too. It may be a minor reason, but it may be an important reason.”

“Then what are you going to do? Are you going to keep gathering information?”

Jack patted his chin.

“We should continue to collect information, but it would be meaningless to get information that is circulating outside like it is now. It's because I looked around the town tower and the surrounding shops, where the rumors about the tower are most likely to flow. From now on, we will have to get inside information.”

"how?"

Jack chuckled.

“Can’t we just dig into the parties involved?”

“If you are a party… Are you talking about Elena Dwayne?”

As if teaching one to a disciple who knows ten, Zich nodded his head and smiled.

"right. I already know where she is and what she is doing. I got a rough idea of ​​what she wanted by word of mouth. It is very easy to get into the heart of a human who is dazed by conflict and anxiety about the family and the future.”

“… You know you look like a scumbag villain right now?”

Hans and Snock, who were walking a certain distance from Zich and Lyla, also nodded slightly. But after all, Zich is Zich. He didn't even snort.

“What afresh. Even if I do good deeds, I never forgot for a day that I was trash.”

Rather, he spoke boldly.

Lyla, Hans and Snock didn't open their mouths. What did you say when you admit it like that?

“Oh, and you shouldn’t say that.”

Zich was shoulder-to-shoulder with Lyla.

“Have you not forgotten the contract? This is something that could be deeply related to my hobbies, so of course you should cooperate.”

Seeing Laila's distorted face, Zich smiled brightly.

“Come on. trash friend. Your path ahead is just trash like me.”

puck!

Lyla's elbow slammed into Zich's stomach.

* * *

Elena came to the store. Own

My grandfather and father had an argument over a plan.

It was very heartbreaking, but she couldn't give up on her dream.

Therefore, he had no choice but to come back to the store with the unfinished artifacts he had created.

While setting up the store, he felt the gaze of other wizards around him. A look that can never be said to be pretty.

However, Elena moved more busily.

Even though she has changed like this because she is so shy now, Elena's original personality was very strong.

It was also because of her original personality that she was able to push her own stubbornness this far.

As before, they display items and wait for customers. In the meantime, she opened a thick magic book to pass the time.

Frequently visited by guests. There were often people who looked at the simple but more antique items she made and expressed interest in them.

But the moment they said they weren't artifacts, they turned their backs on them.

People who made an impression and turned around were the best, and there were people who spit out insults, saying they were selling something like this.

And every time it did, the ridicule of the surrounding wizards flew in.

But she persevered. Only for the sake of his dream, he accepted everything and endured.

However, her determination could not make her sell the product. Even today, her products did not sell. She couldn't stop the sigh that leaked out of her mouth.

'No way.'

When I think about it, I never thought that I would even buy such a product. Isn't there only one sold so far?

Suddenly, she remembered the people who bought her products.

A tall, handsome-faced man and the most beautiful woman she had ever seen. And even the man with the luxurious looking sword and the man with the earth revenge. The only people who bought her goods, which everyone laughed at.

"Hello. You are with me today.”

Suddenly, Elena realized that a new guest had arrived in front of her. She hurriedly raised her head. And I was surprised.

Not long ago, people who had bought her goods were standing in front.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 230 screen

“Ah, hello.”

Once you lower your head.

“But for what reason… .”

she asked, hesitatingly. He wondered if he had come to protest against the goods he had sold. But the words she returned were completely different from her worries.

"Because I'm interested in your stuff."

said Jack. Elena blinked. She never imagined that she would really, sincerely listen to those words. Because of that, I couldn't even speak properly.

Zich pulled something out of his pocket. It was an unfinished artifact that Elena sold.

“Why? !”

Elena's eyes suddenly widened. In a hurry, he got up and took the unfinished artifact that Zich was holding.

It was a rude reaction and could have been prevented, but Zich graciously handed it over to her.

Elena tried to use the unfinished artifact. Appearance is the same as before. However, he did not feel the cold aura of iron, which seemed to stimulate him as if he was stabbing his own lack of talent. Rather, it seemed to radiate a soft warmth.

“… It has magic in it.”

'Your senses are fine.'

Seeing Elena's condition calmly, he thought.

Incomplete as if possessed No, Elena immediately noticed the change in the artifact that had to be removed from the modifier of 'incomplete'. He felt the magic flowing through the artifact.

'No, it's rather good, isn't it?'

As iron is difficult to contain magic, no matter how many artifacts were used to complete it, the magical power contained within it was inevitably insignificant.

However, Elena immediately noticed the magical power contained within the iron from a certain distance away.

It was only natural if Zich had the same talent as Elena he knew. But that wasn't good news.

'If the sense of magic is intact, it may be more difficult to find that seal.'

If even she herself, who had an excellent sense of magic, did not notice, it would be an ingenious seal.

'There is a possibility that the seal was found but could not be unlocked... .'

If so, I  would n't  say to my granddaughter to quit magic, becoming one of the world's top magicians .

'Rather, he must have tried to unlock the seal by mobilizing all his forces.'

Elena closed her eyes and listened to the artifact.

Artifact trembled slightly. Magical power moved and a gentle heat spread.

Whoops!

A flame rose above. A dreamlike flame, as if a red flower bud melts into the air and breathes out its last breath. The eyes around them were focused.

'That's great.'

It was the second time he saw it, but Zich was amazed.

The artifacts Elena sold were no big deal.

An artifact that fires short-range flames. However, considering the material of iron, that was a great enough thing. A wizard capable of making useful artifacts out of iron would be Ryla.

But even considering that, Elena's was good enough. The magic circles engraved on the top of the iron plate respond to each other and efficiently control the flames.

Zich is definitely inferior to a wizard in recognizing the greatness of magic. However, he could see how efficiently the flames extending from the iron plate could hit the enemy.

'There are not many flames scattered around uselessly. Even weak power was supplemented by concentrating fire power as much as possible.'

What's even more surprising is that Elena had never even tried that magic circle. That the result was derived only by calculating the theory.

'Only for magic circles and artifacts, there must be no one who can follow his age.'

No, maybe it was the best in the tower.

Elena trembled with emotion. He confirmed that his artifacts were working well and that the magic circle he had engraved was not wrong.

But that feeling didn't last long.

“… Ah!"

He was reminded of the Zich and the others in front of him.

As with most artifacts made from low-quality materials, the number of artifacts she made with iron was also limited. She has now blown away one of the client's artifacts.

“Sin, I’m sorry!”

She hurriedly lowered her head to the ground.

“All right, I’ll compensate you with something else! Or get a refund... !”

"No, thanks."

Zich handed the Artifact again and smiled kindly. The faces of the colleagues who witnessed his smile hardened for an instant, but Elena did not notice.

“I can tell you this, but honestly, it’s not a great artifact, is it?”

"that… Yes… .”

self-esteem hurts However, what the other person said was true and there was something wrong with her, so Elena had no choice but to nod her head.

In addition, Elena, whose self-esteem was extremely low due to continued neglect and failure, was unable to express her opinion as openly as before.

“But you can't enchant artifacts, just because you're a little interested in your artefact craftsmanship.”

“Is that so?”

A person who recognizes his or her strengths. Elena's heart swelled.

“So you and my party said they wanted to talk. May I have a moment?”

Jack took a step back. And Lyla stepped forward.

“My name is Lyla.”

Elena looked at the hand extended forward and Lyla's face alternately.

She wanted to nod her head right away because she was someone who recognized her skills, but she is also from a high family. There were various things to be wary of by a suspicious person approaching suddenly.

Lyla said with a bitter smile.

“I understand that it looks suspicious. But I really want to have a conversation with you. I'm just going to share a few words here, can you please allow me?"

“Well, then what… .”

Elena gently took Laila's hand.

“It’s Elena Dwayne.”

Zich's group left Lyla and left the store. Lila sat down next to Elena.

The small store seemed to be full as soon as two people entered.

"uh… What kind of conversation do you want to have?”

Elena said very awkwardly. My tongue stiffened when I suddenly tried to talk to a stranger. Lila laughed.

“No need to be so nervous. I saw the artifacts Dwayne made and thought it was great.”

Lyla pointed to one of the artifacts on display.

“Can I take a look?”

"Sure."

Lyla lifted the artifact. It was also made of iron. However, the magic circle engraved on the plate was also unique.

Small magic circles are drawn at the vertices of the square iron plate, and complex lines in the center connect the magic circles.

“Jin is a combination of four magic circles. Great idea.”

“Oh, you know?”

Elena, who had been hesitating, was dazzled.

“However, the four magic circles do not operate separately. Did you take only the necessary parts from each magic circle and make it into one magic circle?”

"Yes! That’s why it’s more efficient.”

“Is it okay if I try to activate it?”

"Yes?"

Elena blinked.

“As you know, all my artifacts are unfinished… .”

“If you give me permission, I will put the magic into you.”

Elena was speechless once again. It is a very delicate and difficult task to infuse magical power into an iron artifact. At least it's not something to be done on this sparsely populated street.

However, the beautiful woman in front of her was saying such words casually.

“Ah, isn’t it a bit odd to touch a product after all? Then I bought this too... .”

“Oh, no! You can do it!”

said Elena. However, the light of doubt that permeated his eyes did not go out.

'Even in the tower, there are few people who can put magic power into iron.'

But after a while, Elena had no choice but to open her mouth stupidly and stare at what was in front of her.

Whoa!

There was a slight vibration from the iron plate in Lyla's hand. I could feel the magic that was seeping out of her hand pounding on the iron plate.

Elena looked into Lyla's face. Her face was calm.

I didn't close my eyes or make any impressions to concentrate. Not even a drop of sweat came from doing a difficult job. It was just calm.

And, as Elena knew, no one had such a calm complexion when instilling magical power into artifacts. Isn't that also the magic power of iron on the roadside?

Maybe he was just pouring magic into the iron. I also had that suspicion.

Of course, when that happens, the artifact doesn't work. Pouring magic power into iron. Knights can do it too. Isn't that one of their fighting methods?

In order to complete the artifact, it is necessary to give the feeling of drawing magic along the magic circle based on a perfect understanding of the magic that the artifact implements and a detailed analysis of the magic circle engraved on the artifact.

Therefore, it is difficult to manufacture artifacts. Other wizards also used auxiliary devices.

So it was natural for Elena to be suspicious of Lyla's actions.

However, Elena's doubts gradually turned into astonishment, shock, and admiration. Her sensitive senses felt it. that the artifacts are faithfully completed.

“Okay.”

I don't even feel like I've done anything that difficult. As if she had just swept the yard, Lyla put the artifact down.

Elena gulped down her saliva when she saw the artifact.

“Come on, can I touch it for a moment?”

"Please."

Just like receiving a treasure that will never come to the royal family, Elena received an artifact. Then I swept the surface.

same as before All of a sudden, the iron plate was showing a soft warmth instead of the cold chill.

“Can I try it once?”

As Lyla nodded, Elena hurriedly activated the Artifact.

Hwareuk!

A fireball the size of a walnut rose above the artifact. It was spinning wildly like a predator looking for prey.

Elena looks at Lyla. Her eyes filled with respect.

Laila did not avert her eyes even from that gaze, but instead smiled softly. But inwardly, he sighed.

'I feel bad for deceiving an innocent child.'

Of course, conversations with Elena seemed to mirror her as well. Perhaps because she dug only artifacts and magic circles, the unfinished artifacts she presented were armed with brilliant ideas.

Just talking to Elena would be a different experience, and there was a possibility that it could lead to improvement of Lyla's skills.

There was one thing that bothered her.

'Because this is also a job.'

After telling Elena to talk, I remembered Zich's sly smile.

'How would you feel if someone like you, who was like your utopia, appeared next to a little boy who was disappointed and hurt that he couldn't achieve his dream? Naturally, the walls of my heart will crumble as a feeling of great respect rises. Then, if you treat me with a little kindness, I will fall in love with you. Then it's over. All that's left is how to cook him.'

I won't do anything bad. As she comforted herself, Laila smiled awkwardly at Elena, who gave her a lot of respectful glances.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 231 screen

The conversation between Lyla and Elena continued. Already, Elena completely threw away the awkwardness of the first meeting.

Except for one magical power, Elena, who had a very outstanding talent, had noticed.

'This man is truly a great wizard!'

It's like talking to her grandfather, who is the mage master and is praised as the best wizard in Snoowick.

Of course, that was a long time ago. After it became clear that she had no magical talent, Wilwes never talked about magic with Elena.

Although she often talks with her father, Orland, unfortunately, conversations with Orland did not satisfy her desires.

But now, a person who can perfectly satisfy Elena's needs has appeared.

Naturally, the alertness from earlier melted very easily, like a piece of ice dropped into hot water.

If you think about it, it's a suspicious situation. A great wizard appeared in front of a girl from a good family who was thirsty for magic, who would make her wish come true. Even though it was cunning, it was too cunning.

But Elena was so engrossed in the conversation that she couldn't even think about it.

Lyla picked up another unfinished artifact.

“It’s made in a thoroughly authentic way.”

“Change is behind the basics. once from the root

I have to be strong. Even when I make several anomalies, I always make one authentic.”

“Good idea.”

Elena's mood improved at Lyla's praise. But as soon as the next words came, my mood plummeted in the opposite direction.

“You seem to have learned from a good person.”

"•••Yes."

Elena's tone was noticeably lowered. It's not like the girl she used to talk about with excitement until now.

Elena learned magic from her grandfather, Wilwes Dwenyin. Naturally, when the topic of the person who taught her came up, she could not help but lose her energy.

Lyla's conscience throbbed. Her conscience wasn't covered in Orihalcon like Zich. Besides, talking with Elena was also very enjoyable for her.

'He speaks well. I have talent.'

No matter how crowded they were, would they say that he was one of those who killed Zich, who became the Demon King?

But I felt guilty that I had deceived her that much.

But it was necessary. And the results will turn for the better. for now.

'Catch your heart!'

“Why did you suddenly lose your energy?”

“Oh, nothing.”

Elena frowned quickly. Lyla looked into her eyes.

“I don’t think it’s anything. Is there something bad about it?”

''  Oh ,  that's... .”

Elena Hill Laila noticed the hilkkeum off  watch.

'Can I tell you?'

No matter how close I got to the woman in front of me, I couldn't help but worry about suddenly talking about sensitive family circumstances.

Of course, normally, you wouldn't have to worry about it. However, Elena didn't want to be in an awkward situation with a person she could talk to, Lyla.

The conclusion is compromise. I decided to explain the details to some extent while drawing them together.

“I can no longer learn magic from him.”

“Oh, I’m sorry. I spoke carelessly.”

"it's okay."

“But you will soon find another good teacher. There are a lot of people out there who will look out for someone as talented as you.

Elena bowed her head.

“Well, did I say something else wrong?”

“•••No one wants to teach me. I have no talent.”

“Does the phrase ‘I have no talent’ have anything to do with what the wizard at the store next door said before?”

Elena nodded her head.

“No matter how talented you are, what do you do? Even if you can create a magic circle of artifacts and memorize the chant without making mistakes, it is a completely useless technique if you don’t have magical power.”

It was a desperate content, but Elena's words were calm. However, it rather showed her despair.

How many times have you cried and how frustrated you must have been before you could speak so calmly? How hard and how painful it was.

And nevertheless, how much he loved magic so much that he couldn't let it go.

Laila felt like Elena's screams echoed in her ears.

“… But you haven't given up yet, have you?"

Elena looks up at Lyla. Elena's eyes widened.

“Otherwise, I wouldn’t be studying magic like this.”

Lyla's gaze was fixed on the spellbook Elena always carried.

"•••Yes."

“I think this business is also trying to make money to learn magic, is that right?”

Elena nodded her head.

“Then how about this, Mr. Dwayne? Learning magic from me.”

"Yes?"

Elena answered stupidly.

“How about learning magic from me? Oh, I can't trust you because you're a wandering wizard... .”

“Oh, no! That's not it!”

Elena quickly denied it.

“Then it’s decided!”

Lyla said with a smile.

“But my magic… .”

“It hasn’t been decided that I don’t have magical powers yet.”

“Still, if you haven’t released your magic until now, you can say that it has no magic or dragon-level magic… The person who taught me magic told me. And the latter is unrealistic.”

“That’s right. However, there is a possibility that it was not released for other reasons. Besides, it's really rare, but who knows if you really have dragon-grade magic'?”

“•••Really?”

After a really long time, I hear hopeful words from anyone other than my father.

But Lila shook her head.

“To be honest, it’s a really, really low chance.”

Elena's shoulders slumped.

“But did you know? Still, you didn't give up, did you? Then I'll put a hand on it. Oh, of course, I can't do it for long. I'm a wandering wizard. How is it'?"

Elena was conflicted. But it wasn't very long. The only person who supports his path is his father. However, it is difficult to learn from his father, who is very busy and has a divided background.

There was a way for her to learn magic again.

If you think about it, you don't even need to worry about it.

“Come on, thank you!”

Elena bowed her head.

Laila and Elena were talking to a temporary teacher and apprentice after fixing their relationship. A shadow was cast before them.

“Did you have a good conversation?”

it was jig

“Are you here already?”

“Already. look at the sky In a little while, the sun will go down completely.”

As he said, there was a thick sunset in the sky.

“If you were so engrossed in the conversation that your notion of time collapsed, would the conversation go well?”

“Oh, yes. I have something to tell you.”

Lyla puts Elena next to her.

“I decided to serve as this child’s temporary teacher for a while.”

“Hey, it’s Elena Dwayne!”

She bows her head to Zich. Zich blinked in surprise. But then he smiled and reached out to her.

“I’ve heard the name before, but it’s not bad to hear it again. This is Zich. No last name, just call me Zich.”

“If you are a close friend of the teacher, please stop talking.”

“Is that so? Then I'll do that. I think I am a little older.”

And Zich looked at Lyla.

“I was a little surprised. You went to talk, but suddenly you got a disciple.”

“It’s temporary.”

“Still, a disciple is a disciple, right?”

Zich turned to Elena.

“Being a disciple of that guy, he may have to suffer a bit, but he has certain skills and teaching skills, so there won’t be anything wrong with learning. So study hard. And if you want to teach me something strange, come and tell me.”

“There is no such thing!”

The casual behavior was so natural that even Elena, who had not seen it for a while, had no choice but to laugh.

A new priest was quietly born under the sunset sky.

* * *

Zich and Lila broke up with Elena. It was late, so we decided to meet the next day.

On the way back to the dormitory, Zich said with his arms outstretched.

“It’s easy, it’s easy! How boring would life be if it went on like this!”

“… You're definitely the one to say it's no fun there."

Lyla grumbled.

"what? Why are you so weak?”

“Unlike you, I feel a sense of remorse. Unlike you, my conscience is intact.”

“Isn’t it too uncomfortable? Let go of that conscience quickly. There is nothing good about having it.”

“If you are an ordinary person, you don’t get thrown away just because you want to throw it away!”

“So, make an effort. Trying to let go of your conscience. Do you know that I became such a piece of garbage without trying for a day or two?”

“Who the hell is trying to be trash!”

“Can you see this child? Are you ignoring the rubbish that is widespread in this world? To deny my efforts more than that! How much I tried to catch up with these bastards who were born trash! To put it bluntly, I worked several times harder than I tried to get the power to be called the Demon King!”

“Ah, noisy! Shut up! Talking to you will mess up your head, so shut up!”

Jack left. However, the form of giggling and smiling was rather more heated.

“You did a great job, Lyla. Nicely took the guy's teacher position. Now, under the pretext of teaching him magic, we can thoroughly examine his body.”

Then you might understand why she can't use her magic.

“And there will probably be rumors. She's a pretty famous girl in the city, so the story of following an unknown woman will spread quickly. Then there's the possibility of contact with Will Wes Dwayne or Orland Dwayne."

It is then possible to observe two suspicious persons.

“So, don’t just think of it as cheating. It's definitely a good thing for Elena Dwayne."

“Well, that’s salvation.”

Lyla sighed.

“Are you still talented?”

"•••What are you talking about."

What other nonsense is this guy talking about? Laila narrowed her eyes and looked at Zich.

“I went to recon in the middle to see if you were doing well while gathering information around you. Hey, I was amazed too. No matter how vigilant you are, how can you deceive someone so easily.”

And Zich wiped away his smiling face and put his hand on Lyla's shoulder. And said seriously.

“You have talent. The ability to cheat. The form that binds an innocent child like that is just a professional scammer.”

“I didn’t learn everything from you!”

“Yeah, that’s it. I didn't really teach you. What you learned over your shoulder and put it into practice. So it worked out so well. Perhaps your moral talent is so great that it even compares to your magical talent... !”

"shut up!"

perok

A dull sound of hitting someone. Then there is a loud and vulgar laughter.

The two of them walked down the street in such a loud voice under the sky gradually turning indigo blue.

After breakfast, Zich and Lila left the dorm. Starting today, I was going to take a class on Elena.

The place they were heading to was the horse tower.

Originally, I was going to do it in a field outside the castle. Probably because magic is a science that can cause a lot of damage, so it was difficult to properly demonstrate it in the city.

However, Elena expressed displeasure.

It was difficult for her, the granddaughter of the High One, to go out of the city without permission.

It is because of his father's protection that he sells unfinished artifacts in the city. Even her father wouldn't allow her to leave the city.

Therefore, the horse tower was chosen as an alternative.

The horse tower, built for wizards, was paid for and rented the space for a certain period of time.

It was also a support for the wizards who did not have their own laboratory and the wandering wizards who came to see Snuwick's fame.

Of course, the financial factors that the tower obtains were also attractive.

“Still, I borrowed the space of Yongke Tower. Weren't you in a position to sell unfinished artifacts because you didn't have money?"

Lyla responded to Zich's murmur.

“Still, it seems that she was a rich girl and had some money. It's only been a while since I've grown up to study magic."

“Aww. Did you mean to sell unfinished artifacts for so much needed money?”

“It was so urgent.”

Apparently, Elena's desire for magic was very special to Laila, a wizard, so Laila was very favorable to Elena.

“Here it is!”

When the two arrived in front of the tower, Elena, who had arrived first, waved her arms. All eyes were on her, but she didn't care and ran to Laila.

"Hi Sir!"

Lyla smiled bitterly.

“Hello, Dwayne.”

I decided to establish a relationship as a teacher and a disciple and teach magic, but there was still awkwardness in being called a teacher like this.

What's more, if someone who calls himself a teacher brings so much respect and wonder.

But at the same time, Elena was also sad.

How much do you want to learn magic and how can you treat strangers so friendly just because you teach them magic?

'I really need to solve this child's problem.'

The meeting with Elena Dwayne was thoroughly planned, but at least she hoped that Elena's wish would come true.

“But this person… .”

Elena, who arrived next to Laila, looked at Zich.

Zich showed a nice smile.

“See you again, Miss Dwayne.”

"Hello. Did you say Mr. Zich?”

"right."

While greeting each other face to face, Elena glanced at Laila with a smirk.

It seemed like he was asking for an explanation as to why Zich had come with him.

Lyla said with a sly smile.

“Help. Shouldn't it be something like a target to show you a magic example?"

“A mark, a target?”

Elena was astonished.

Could it be that a living human was used as a magic target?

However, the person who was called the target showed no signs of surprise.

Rather, he smiled and spoke to Elena in a small way, as if telling a secret. Of course, it was a voice that could be heard by Laila as well.

“As you can see, that guy isn't that dirty-tempered. He's also cruel enough to try to target living people as magic targets. So, don't relax, and when I tell you to run away, run unconditionally... .”

“Speak nonsense.”

Lyla grabbed Zich's neck and pulled him tighter.

Seeing that, Zich wrinkled one eye at Elena.

“As you can see, it’s like this. I brought this guy because I thought it might be of some help to your magic. He's definitely talented."

“Is he a wizard too?”

"no. He's a knife sharpener But don't worry. Even if it's a swordsman, he's comparable to me when it comes to mana control, so there will definitely be times when it will be helpful."

Elena was surprised. To call him a swordsman, he must be a knight or a warrior.

But the magic control of such a person is equivalent to that of a magician, even a great wizard like Lyla.

As Elena, who did not even realize her magical powers, Zich also seemed like a great person.

"I'm still standing here, so I'll ask you for guidance, Miss Dwayne."

“Oh, I will!”

Elena hurriedly nodded at Zich's words and led the two into the tower.

As the three of them entered the tower, the people around

eyes poured out

“There is a lot of interest in the surroundings. But I don't think it's because of you this time, Laila."

Due to her non-human appearance, people always focused on Lyla when she was out. However, the current gaze was not the usual gaze.

“•••Probably because of me.”

Elena said cautiously.

“Is the lady’s surname Dwayne related to Matthew?”

“You are Grandpa.”

"Hmm, I guess I'm just guessing what's going on."

Zich patted his chin and muttered. But that's it. There were no more questions.

“… Aren't you going to ask any more?"

“Do you really need to do that? It's okay now that I know the intent of the gaze. I feel a little bad for not being very friendly.”

"that is… .”

“All right, miss. Expectations go, but we don't need to know why. 'Cause we're just teaching the girl magic. So, straighten your back, girl.”

Zich grabbed Laila's shoulder and gave her strength to lift it up.

“At least don't feel guilty about it. We are the ones who care less about the gaze of others than the stones lying on the side of the road.”

“It’s only you.”

Lyla bruised Zich. But he spoke to Elena with a kind expression.

“Still, that guy is right. It's my choice to teach you magic, so I don't care what other people see. So, be honest with yourself. Understand?"

“… Yes!"

Elena straightened her waist as Zich said. I made my stride a little wider and waved my arms confidently.

At first, it was a girl named Elena Dwayne who was full of self-esteem and confidence. It has lost a lot of its former appearance due to the current environment, which is like being driven to a dead end, but if there is a certain opportunity, it will be able to recover immediately.

“I have booked a room.” Protruding her head to the counter, Elena said so.

It seems that the people inside also recognized Elena.

But I didn't express myself. He was simply devoted to his job.

“What is the name of the person making the reservation?”

“It’s Elena Dwayne.”

The employee who was going through several documents in front of them pulled out one of them.

“I’ll ask for your autograph.”

Elena grabbed a pen, put ink on it, and scribbled her autograph. Meanwhile, the employee took out a key from the drawer.

Elena handed the signed document to the staff. The employee handed over the key after receiving the document.

When Elena picked up the key, the staff gave a description of the room to be rented, the rental period, and rough notes.

“Let’s go!”

Elena took the lead, and Zich and Lyla followed her. Behind their backs, many people's eyes were drawn with curiosity.

Zich's group walked up the stairs. After passing through the 3rd floor open to the general public, we entered the 4th floor, which can be called a real horse pagoda .

Due to the nature of the tower, which allocates a higher number of floors to a person in a higher position, the rental room was placed on the lower floor.

The room Elena was assigned to was on the fourth floor.

“There it is.”

Through the narrow hallway, Elena found her destination, a room.

shudder!

When I opened the door, I saw a small room.

"sorry. This is the best room you can rent at my level... .”

"it's okay. This is enough.”

Lyla encouraged Elena and entered the room first. Zich followed after them.

shudder!

I closed the door and looked around the room.

Stone walls and ceilings. The rectangular room looked very ordinary.

But, should I still say that the tower is a horse tower? It was by no means an ordinary room.

Zich walked over to the nearest wall and put his hand on it.

“Magic is spinning.”

I could clearly feel the magical power flowing through the wall.

“It is said that when the tower was designed, it was made that way. Because of the magic that flows through the floor, walls, and ceiling of the room, low-level magic cannot do any harm here.”

At Elena's explanation, Zich nodded.

It was a small room, but had a desk and a few chairs. The three pulled up a chair and sat down.

“First, I need to find out how much you studied.”

With that said, Lyla began to question Elena. Elena answered quickly, but was confused or did not give a proper answer to some of the questions.

“Did most of you study the fire system?”

"Yes. I was also influenced a lot because the school my grandfather was attending was strong.”

Zich, who was listening next to him, nodded.

Elena Dwayne, whom she had dealt with before returning, was also special in fire magic.

“I saw the level of the magic circle overflowing with unfinished artifacts you made, would you like to sing a choral song this time?”

"Yes!"

Elena closed her eyes. Her mouth twitched and an unfamiliar voice began to flow out.

It's a voice that Zich, who is not a wizard, doesn't know what he's talking about.

However, it seemed that neither Elena, who spoke, nor Laila, who was listening, had any difficulty in interpreting the words.

"you're good. The pronunciation is clear and there is no stuttering.”

Elena's cheeks lit up at Lyla's praise.

After that, Lyla tried to do various things to Elena. Elena followed them frequently.

After a while, Lila nodded her head.

“The basics are very well-established and the application is good. Is it really that great?”

"thank you!" Elena felt like she was going to fly away. Lyla acknowledged that the effort she had made so far was not wrong with the time she had spent.

However, Laila's next words made the grass die again.

“Really, magic was the only problem.”

"•••Yes."

“May I explore your magical powers?”

"Yes. But it will be of no use. My grandfather and father tried a few times and failed.”

No matter how small their magic power, those two have the ability to explore.

However, neither of them felt any trace of magical power.

It was the perfect proof that the magic had not been released.

But even so, Elena gently extended her hand to Lyla. It was a struggle to hold on to even vain hopes.

Lyla carefully pours her magic power into Elena's body and begins the search. However, Lyla's magic flowed smoothly through Elena's body without any obstacles.

It meant that Elena's body had no magic power.

"•••how is it?"

Elena asked cautiously.

Lyla shook her head.

“Neither can I find it.”

Elena shook her head.

(Continued on next page)

But soon she lifted her head.

I've heard it a few times already. The wound heals and heals, and a thick scab sits on it, and now I don't even feel any pain.

"it's okay. It was what I expected.”

That's why I was able to say it so quietly. But the two who looked at her did not think so.

Not only Lyla, but Zich also clicked inwardly.

'No matter how much you are injured, there are some wounds that you can't get used to.'

To Zich, the current Elena was just like that.

He said he was okay with getting used to it, but he only pretended to be like that, and blood was overflowing from the wound.

Zich, who openly calls himself trash to the villain, never rejects those who do what he wants to do.

Isn't that also the reason for raising Hans and Snock, who would be an obstacle if they walked the path of the Demon King again in the first place?

Because of this, he had a little sympathy for Elena, who could not do what she wanted to do.

But that's all. Also, Zich was Zich.

“Could I ever check Miss Dwayne’s magic?”

"Yes?"

“Are you sure it was all wizards who tested Miss Dwayne’s magic so far? A swordsman like me might be viewed from a slightly different angle than the wizards.”

“Ah, that’s how I see it!”

Even though he was hurt like that, he grabs hold of the small hope that has come back. Elena held out her hand.

Lyla's eyes are sharp as they shoot.

Zich's words made sense, but to be honest, the odds were extremely low.

There was a very high probability that the result would be to simply trample on Elena's hope once more. That's why she didn't like Zich's swordsman.

But it didn't stop. It's because he wasn't a great person to stop just because Zich stopped him, and there was some truth to that statement.

In addition, from Lyla's point of view, there was something that had to be done in accordance with Zich's plan.

“I have nothing to do with it either.”

“That’s right.”

It was nonetheless Elena took care of her expression, but she couldn't help but tremble in her voice.

Lila sighed slightly.

“Are we going to end up here today? the first day

It's enough for you to do this lightly

I think."

Elena nodded her head.

* * *

After breaking up with Elena, Zich and Lila were returning to their dorms.

Lila looked at Zich with a blank slate. But in the end, I just sighed and couldn't say anything.

He just tapped the shoulder of Zich, who had innocent eyes that said he didn't know anything.

Jack asked.

"how was it?"

“It’s really okay. I thought about it the last time we talked, but now I think I'm more talented than I thought I was then. If you can support me with your magical powers, you will come out with a truly outstanding wizard.”

"no. Not that.”

Zich knew much better than she did how great Elena Dwayne could be.

“Did you find anything on that guy’s body?”

“Honestly, I didn’t.”

Lyla shook her head.

“I looked very closely, but no magic was found. It is a body that has not been released from typical magical powers. Otherwise, there is no congenital power.”

“But he’s definitely not a man without magic.”

That was what Zich could assert.

“Then the only thing that can be said is that the magic has not been released.”

“Neither is it. His magical powers aren't that great."

The hypothesis that he was born with no magical powers or that he had not yet been released was not worth considering for two people with information about the future.

“How were you?”

This time, in reverse, Lila asked Zich.

“So did I.”

“Hmm, that’s the starting point.”

“Well, you didn’t think from the beginning that you would make a great discovery, didn’t you? Now let's take a look at his body little by little. And even the guys salpyeoya father or grandfather and that  you mean. "

“Then, should we continue educating Elena Dwayne for now?”

“You look good. Do you seem to like it?”

“At least I’m cuter than you.”

"You say I'm cuter than Elena Dwayne? This guy ignores my cuteness. Where can I show my cuteness trained as a demon king... !”

“Oh, little!”

Zich and Lila continued to teach Elena for several days.

What Lyla was teaching, Elena absorbed the dry land as if it were absorbing water. The education continued, admiring each other.

However, unlike the two who were satisfied with each other, more and more unfavorable gazes focused on the two of them.

They completely ignored them. However, there is no law telling the other person to remain still just because they are still.

Eventually the incident happened.

"Wait a little  let."

Even today, the heads of the three people who were trying to rent a room at the reception desk of the tower went back at once.

There was a man by their side. The man, who looked quite young, was dressed in an outfit that anyone could recognize as a wizard.

A staff with crystals embedded in its long robes. If he had gray hair and a long white beard, he was a typical sorcerer to the extent that he would have been invited to play the role of a wizard in any theater troupe at any moment.

“What?”

Jack came out.

The man's gaze shifted to Zich and then to Elena Dwayne behind him. Then I looked at Zich again.

“The person behind you has more to do than you. Get out of the way.”

“I refuse. As you can see, we are busy right now.”

The man looked at Zich with displeasure. With that gaze alone, Zich was able to understand his opponent to some extent.

'Is it a child of a so-called family with high-status parents?'

It was just to send a glance that it was unpleasant to get in the way of one's work.

Zich's head turned tight and analyzed the situation.

'Doesn't that seem to be the case with Elena Dwayne? The reason for the dissatisfaction is obvious.'

As a wizard, the fact that she, who was sentenced to death, went to and from the tower would have been dissatisfying to the wizards.

'But no matter how much it is, there's not enough justification to directly argue like this.' Obviously there must be other reasons involved.

Zich looked at the man's gaze again.

'I think Lyla and I are also the object of dissatisfaction... .'

No, that's a look of suspicion rather than dissatisfaction. Zich noticed that the situation was about to turn around.

'You seem to see me and Lyla as cheaters. And I see Elena Dwayne as an idiot playing with fraud.'

Then the front and back will match.

The situation was barely understood. So now the question is how to use it.

'Cover? Or do you increase the board?'

It's a cover. It's okay if you ignore it. No matter how prolific I am, this person will not be able to continue to argue with Elena Dwayne.

But Zich didn't think it was a bad idea to grow the board.

'I've been observing Elena Dwayne for a few days, but I haven't found any singularities.' The situation is stagnant. If so, it wouldn't be a bad idea to pop it once around this time.

'Let's grow!'

And that fit Zich's own inclination.

Zich raised one arm and signaled Lyla to stay still. Then I looked at the man.

Behind the scenes, Elena did not know what to do. It seemed like he was having an argument because of himself.

Lyla stopped her from stepping forward to stop the fight.

"Teacher?"

"it's okay. Let’s leave it alone.”

So, the two took a step back.

“••• When you say something nice, get out of the way.”

said the man harshly.

“That’s a good thing… . In Snoowick, the meaning of a good word is slightly different. Anyone can see that you are going to kill a person now.”

“I have no intention of joking around. Turn on the rain right now!”

“If you don’t want to play with words, you can go your way.”

And Zich extended his hands to the side as if guiding the way.

The man's grim gaze grew harsher.

“Dwayne!”

Elena was surprised.

“How long have you been dreaming like that! Aren't you ashamed of your grandfather or father?"

It seemed that Zich decided to raise his voice as he didn't want to get out of the way. Elena's head dropped at the man's remarks.

“Oh, it’s really noisy. Did you chew on any dragon's vocal cords?" Zich, who had exaggeratedly covered his ears with his hands, grumbled.

“And not only is his voice loud, but he is also very rude. What kind of noble person are you, raising your voice to a disciple of a close friend like that?”

"•••student?"

"Yes. student."

Zich nodded his head as if to purify.

“Behind me right now, I have a very pretty close friend who is serving as Elena Dwayne’s interim teacher. So I can't just ignore your abusive language."

The man looked at Laila.

Lila passed the man's gaze without a clear expression.

"huh! A man who seems to be just twenty now is teaching someone? I think it’s a good idea to develop your own skills before playing as a teacher!”

“That's up to the parties to figure out. And my friend is also a so-called genius. There is nothing wrong with educating Miss Dwayne.”

" genius'?"

The man looked at Laila again.

A look that laughs at anyone who sees it. The man sighed and looked directly at Zich again.

“Hey, cheaters.”

Now there are no specifications.

“I don’t know where I heard about that guy, but wake up from your dream and go back quietly. You must have thought that if you tricked me with magic, your morale would be successful... . Well, frankly, that idiot is eoteuni hooked fully operational atdago guys are pretty good view E haetgeo Or that stupid teeth even more foolish than I expected me. "

The man stared coldly at Elena once.

“But neither the tower nor the snoowick are as good as you guys are allowed to install it inside the tower. The guy's family, of course. This is advice. Up to this point, you can just move on to something not funny that happened by accident, so let go of your hand and quietly disappear.”

It was as if he had become a very generous ruler.

But Zich didn't even want to be touched by his generosity. Rather, I just wanted to give back the other person's reaction.

So I did.

“Hey, Mojiri.”

The man's expression contorted.

“I don’t know what kind of precious family he is, but seeing people he sees for the first time openly pretending to be scammers, must he not have received proper character education?”

“This child… !”

“Okay. Anyway, each other's opinions seem to be parallel lines. Then there is only one way left. From what you're saying, you look like a pretty good wizard your age.

right?"

"Yes. He's a con artist, so he has at least one eye."

said the man proudly.

"Then let's not talk like we're tired."

Zich extended his thumb and pointed to the back, to be precise, to Lyla.

“Then check it out for yourself. Whether we are cheaters or not, whether my friend is qualified to educate Miss Dwayne or not.”

(Continued on next page)

# No. 234 screen

There was a buzz around. I can only remember one meaning of Zich's provocative behavior and the words to check it out for yourself.

“So, you mean try hanging out with that girl, right?”

The man seems to be a bit perplexed too. But there was no sign of fear of a duel. On the contrary, there was even a smile on his face.

“You don’t think my friend is not good enough to teach Miss Dwayne?”

"Of course. No matter how much magic is the science of talent, there is a degree to that. A wizard of that age would teach others? It’s funny.”

“So, you should check it out yourself.”

Lyla, who had been watching the fight between Zich and the man from behind, sighed a little.

“Anyway, that guy… .”

The look of excitement was evident.

"sorry. Just because of me... .”

“No, it’s okay because you didn’t do anything wrong.”

Arguments are theirs, not theirs. It may be misleading, but they didn't do anything wrong.

'right? At least now, right? I'm just teaching Miss Dwayne magic.'

With a plan no different from deceiving Elena, she forced her aching conscience to be crushed.

“Still, it’s my fault, so I have to intervene… .”

“Did I say I was okay?”

Lyla caught Elena who was about to step out.

"do not worry. Because Zich is a guy who is sure to solve the case no matter how many times he sees it.”

In the meantime, I try to grow my own business, though.

'Still, the solution is the solution.'

Lyla turned her head away from her screaming conscience once more.

“I will, I will. In other words, stop paying attention to us from now on. Yes, study hard on that brilliant magic trick. Huh?"

Zich patted the man's shoulder as if he was handling a child.

widely!

The man coldly slapped Zich's arm.

"great."

he revealed it

“It’s fine. I'm also tired of staying in my room and studying magic, but it's not bad to have a match. It would also be good to properly educate the brainy scammers who dare to call themselves educators.”

“Uh, hey. Are you really going to do it?”

A man who appeared to be the man's colleague spoke to the man.

"of course. rather good Duels with other guys are rarely allowed, despite the fact that they are in a different school. In that sense, a duel with these guys will be fine. Anyone who sees it is a wanderer.”

“But the Master or the high-ranking people in the tower probably won’t look at you nicely.”

“Listen to some nagging. Backing down after an argument is also damaging to our school's honor.”

“I’m sorry for interrupting you during the conversation, but no matter who you are, you are the one who started the fight. Could you please do not defer the responsibility here in a secret way?”

With a smile, Zich intervened.

“Oh, don’t get me wrong. I really like that kind of rubbish behavior. After all, there are trashy people all over the world, and when I think about how good my time is compared to those people, life feels really rewarding. But my close friends and their pupils are just ordinary people, so they would be reluctant to see such vulgar behavior.”

"•••Garbage?"

The man's eyes darkened. Zich made a puzzled expression. very large and exaggerated.

“Did you ever think of yourself as an ordinary person? Hey, I thought I had no conscience, but this is something beyond me. Is it the root of indifference? no no. Is this a matter of perception? Is it something you can't recognize that you're trash?"

“This child!”

The man grabbed Zich by the neck. Zich did not rebel.

“He doesn't look like a wizard in his vulgar words and deeds! If so, they must be ignorant bastards who carry a piece of metal and install it! How dare such a person insult me ​​like that?”

“You use violence right away because you have heard something you don’t like. Which side would the word superficial fit into? Am I trying to solve it with a dignified conversation? Or are you using violence like now? Even if you ask the goblin right before being eaten by the ogre, I don't think you'll get the answer wrong. Oh, come to think of it, do you not know the answer? Excuse me. It's rude to say something like that in front of a person, even if he's shorter than a goblin. Yep."

Elena opened her mouth lightly. Man and I get angry, and Zich smiles round and round and speaks quietly. But the content of those dull words never matched the tone.

“Are you surprised?”

Lyla said with a bitter smile.

“I, that one… . that… .”

Elena looks at Zich and stutters. The Zich she saw was a playful person, but a kind person who was polite and occasionally participated in her magic study.

However, the man who was arguing in front of her right now was a different person from the image of Zich she had.

“Originally, he’s that kind of guy. He has a bad personality and doesn't mind calling himself trash. And especially cruel to enemies.”

“•••Are you a bad person?

"Well?"

Lila looked at Zich.

“Humanity can never be said to be good, but is that a bad person? At least it doesn't harm ordinary people, and grumpy is only for bad guys. Be kind to those who are kind.”

Elena remembered Zich, who encouraged her.

“Well, if I were to describe him now… .”

Lyla raised a finger and said.

“Are you going to be a good person with a bad personality?”

“•••You have a complicated personality.”

"right? So I have a headache.”

"great!"

Their words were interrupted by a loud burst of sound.

“It’s a duel right now! Let's show her the magic difficulty first! I will show you how stupid it is to talk about education!”

The man exclaimed excitedly. He was still holding Zich's collar.

“And next is you.”

life is messy

“Don’t even think about running away! It's a one-on - one match between a wizard and a swordsman . You know that if it's one-on - one, the test has an advantage, right? This means I'm going to set you a handicap! So you guys are also dueling with me! Do you understand!”

Zich laughed bitterly. From the viewer's point of view, it's extremely unlucky to the point that it's annoying and irritating.

"great. I'll do anything But do you know that there are many mountains to overcome before that?”

"OK! Don't knock it down right now!"

“Then let’s do it.”

Zich tapped the man's neck. Then he looked at Laila.

“Did you hear me?”

“I heard you very well.” Lyla walked out to the side of Zich with a pale face.

“Can I have a duel with you?”

"okay!"

“What about the time and place?”

“Here right now!”

Zich's party came down to the basement of the tower. Apparently, there was a duel for the duel between the magicians in the basement of the tower.

It was not only the parties to the duel that came down. Wherever the rumors came from, quite a lot of people surrounded the arena. Most were wizards.

He is looking at the situation with a very interesting expression. Listening to the sound, it seemed that even my spirit was being established.

Everyone is quite nervous when the eyes of many people are gathered. But Lila was blunt. Rather, it seemed to me that I should have expressed it as sullen.

"Teacher! I'll tell you about the other person!"

Apparently, Lyla's opponent was someone Elena knew as well. But Lila shook her head.

“It’s okay.”

“That, though… !”

“It’s okay, lady.”

Sieg leaned back against the small fence that wrapped around the arena, and Zich restrained Elena.

“There is no need to listen to the other person’s information. Lyla is truly an incredibly strong wizard.”

“Whoa!”

Lila laughed a little. He was completely confident of winning this duel.

“But is it a little surprising? I thought I would finish it calmly as if I was just taking a deep breath and dealing with overdue laundry. You are also secretly turning on me.”

“That’s natural.”

Lyla looked at the man across the arena. He was with some who seemed to be close friends. It's a confident expression.

Lyla's expression changed. The little eyes are young, and the sinister smile on the mouth is young.

“Did that guy have a bad attitude towards Miss Dwayne?”

"right. Isn't it a talent to show one's feelings only with such an attitude? If there are more guys like that, people won’t have to use words to communicate.”

“From the attitude and the reactions of the people around him, he must be one of the best wizards in his age group, but he’s a wizard of his age, isn’t he?”

Lila's smile faded away.

“How dare such an ignorant bastard ignore my disciple?”

'This is maddening.'

Zich clicked his tongue. Then I looked at the man who was going to fight Laila.

The man was already up on the arena. He taps the expensive wand on the ground as if to say hello.

But to Zich, the staff looked worse than a weak, half-rotten branch.

“I will go.”

Lyla rushes up the arena.

Looking to the side, Elena was looking up at the arena with a very anxious look.

“Open your eyes wide, girl.”

She looks at Zich.

“Because you can see how great the magician who came out to teach the girl is.”

♦ * *

Whoa!

Magical power flowed around the arena. A light twinkle slowly rises above the small wall surrounding the arena.

'It's a barrier.'

Indeed, the battlefield of the tower. It seems that a duel between wizards is more likely to inflict damage to the surroundings than a duel of a swordsman or warrior type, so this barrier was created.

Most of the personnel, the onlookers, were outside the fence. Inside, there were only Zich, Elena, and a few others who seemed to be the man's acquaintances.

Of course, it's not a great barrier for Lyla. It is a level that can be ripped apart by sneezing.

'But here, that would be enough.'

And Lyla had no intention of using great magic.

“The start signal starts when it falls. No complaints?”

The man raised a coin and said.

"I do not care."

“A match is when someone becomes incapacitated or declares surrender.”

"great."

The man tossed a coin. Soaring high, the coin began to spin and fall. The eyes of the man and Lyla followed the coin.

bang!

The coin hit the floor and bounced.

“Will! Wayne! Con! Miss Win!”

The man raised his wand and began to memorize a spell. At the same time, powerful magic began to swirl from the staff.

Admiration bursts out from the spectators. Seeing that Elena also exclaimed slightly, she seemed to be admiring the man's skills.

“Is that great?”

Zich asked her.

"Yes. The speed and pronunciation of Youngchang are good.

I also like the use of magic. He’s also the hopeful lord of the tower.”

"okay?"

“Isn’t that a scene you see often with a teacher-level wizard?”

“No, it’s true that Lyla is a sophisticated wizard… .”

“Oh, but why… !”

Compared to the man, Lila did not move at all.

At that moment, the man's magic was completed and it was shot at La Ila. Until then, Laila had her wand hung down and did not respond. It was the moment when Lyla's body was about to be exposed as it was in the trajectory of the swirling flames.

right!

Lyla snapped her fingers.

Whoops!

The flames that had been running fiercely exploded.

Lyla brushed the sparks off her clothes. Then he looked at the man who was looking at him with a blank expression. arrogant and arrogant

“Because that guy isn’t just a level wizard.”

Zich's words were not heard by Elena. Elena's eyes were shining so bright that they couldn't shine more than this.

For a moment, silence fell in the arena. But that was also for a while. The reaction of the onlookers exploded in an instant, as if a taut bow was fired.

“Did you just see it! Just that, that’s right!”

“I saw it too!”

People murmured, mentioning one word.

“That’s a silent window!”

Infinite magic. A high-level technique that eliminates even the weakness of a wizard who inevitably has to embrace the weakness of the chanting.

Of course, the power of magic is lowered, but being able to use magic without a chorale was a great benefit for a wizard.

However, as it is such a great technology, the number of people who can use it is limited. A skill that only a handful of geniuses who are truly believed to have been chosen by the heavens can use.

Of course, the wizards watching here now cannot use this technology. And so was the person who was dealing with Lyla now.

"it's over?"

A simple word from Lyla. However, those short and simple words were enough to show her extreme freedom and confidence.

Usually, such an attitude is enough to make the other person feel that he is ignoring him, and the man accepted it as such.

“What, what… .”

Knowing that Lyla was using the silent chant, the man also lost consciousness for a moment. But Lyla's attitude touched his high pride. He flashed his wand again.

"La! Homeel! sign! Towle!”

Lightning this time Brain metastases began to fill his wand. This time, Lila did not move.

The man pointed his wand at Lyla.

"knife!"

Break up!

When the spell was finished, lightning flew in a straight line. But Lila had already snapped her fingers.

kuung

A stone rises in front of her and makes a wall. The lightning hit the wall and was blocked in vain.

The wall disappeared and the man's face entered Laila's gaze. The man was making a pretty funny expression.

Shock, astonishment, jealousy and even fear. A variety of emotions were swirling around.

“I took it twice. Can I attack now?”

Lyla raises her hand. Still, her wand was held in her other hand and dangling.

pooong

There is no sign of a young chant. Literally, a sudden gust of wind hit the man.

“ね!”

The man quickly bowed his head. A sharp blade passed over his head.

“Hmm, there must have been a reason for accepting the duel so easily.”

" Yes?"

Elena responded to Zich's murmuring.

“The guy who’s dealing with Lyla. It’s like a guy familiar with magic duels.”

"Ah yes. Jaywick is also famous in the horse tower. There is also a record of winning the Magic Tower's magic duel that is held once a year.”

jaywick. It was the first time Zich had heard the name of Lyla's fighter. I just stopped hearing that, but Lyla still doesn't know.

But it had to be. To Zich and Lyla, Jake was really just a good thing.

Just because a dog jumps in, you don't usually wonder about the dog's name or anything like that. Just trying to kick you out.

Jawick once again dodged Lyla's attack. It wasn't easy to avoid. I really twisted my body and forced myself to dodge.

'That's not something I avoided.'

Far from maintaining the balance of his body, he fell to the ground without even being able to perform even the basic fall method. A stone was shot at Jaewick.

“Ugh, ahhh!”

Jawick hits the ground with his arms and bounces the boat. It jumped like a frog and then rolled around. Fortunately, Laila's magic was avoided.

“Pick up!”

One of the onlookers stopped the burst of laughter. His lungs tried to keep moving at the sight of Jaewick's unsightly appearance. But I couldn't blame him. Most of the onlookers did.

“Heh heh heh!”

“Pop! Poop!”

Suppressed laughter echoes from all sides. I'm not laughing on purpose. That's because Jae-Week's appearance was unbearably funny.

but some. Obviously there were those who sneered at Jawick with malice.

Is it jealousy? Or did his seemingly bad personality make him an invisible enemy?

'I don't know.'

If that ridicule is directed at you or your party, it may be directed at the enemy. Rather, Zich was on their side.

Cover your mouth and laugh as other onlookers do. But it's too loud to be a breath-taking laugh. It was no different than just listening to it openly.

Even so, Jaewick, whose face was blushed at the ridicule of the spectators, dyed his ears red.

He gets up and looks at Zich. In response, Zich raised his laughter. He grabbed his stomach and smashed the wall behind him.

Jake's gaze grew even more bloody, but there was no time to keep staring at Zich.

Whoo!

“Wow!”

Once again dodge Lyla's magic. Lyla's magic collided with the barrier and was destroyed.

Such a one-sided composition continued. Lyla shoots and Jawick avoids. Jae Wick continued to try to use magic.

'You are singing while moving.'

That skill is also difficult. It is quite difficult to use magic that requires considerable concentration while moving the body. Many wizards would close their eyes and chant in their place.

'I'm sure you have a sense.'

But the problem is that the opponent is Ryline.

"On!"

pooong

Jake once again cast his spell. Lyla took just one step to avoid it. At the same time, they waved their arms.

wow!

An intangible vortex flew towards Jaewick.

"profit!"

He fell down on his stomach. Magic passed over it.

By all accounts, Lyla was playing with him.

“Damn, that’s great.” Elena was completely absorbed in Lyla's movements.

The person who became her teacher was a wizard who exceeded her expectations.

“With such freedom, you can do the choreography! There is no attribute that makes you feel awkward!”

'You could have done that.'

Jike was in his mind, but what she would do in the future was something that only Zich knew.

“This, this, this… !”

Jake trembled at the insult. I want to use magic to mess up my opponent right now.

However, there was a clear difference in skill. But Jake couldn't accept that.

'Is this Ma Win Jawick losing to a wandering wizard like that? Who would be the teacher of that loser, Elena Dwayne?'

can never admit

'I will win by all means!'

Jake memorized the chant again. A fireball appeared in front of him. he threw a fireball

taak

Again, she counteracted the magic. But Jawick's attack didn't end there.

“… Oh?"

Lyla tilted her head at the staff flying in front of her. But he also struck it off with his wand.

But that was Jake's calculation.

“Oh!”

" what!"

The onlookers are buzzing. Elena also opened her eyes wide in surprise.

It was because Jaywick, who had tricked his eyes with his magic and wand, came closer to Laila.

'If you're a woman, physical strength doesn't matter! Once you catch it and feed it, your mind will be shaken to use magic!'

Even as a wizard, his physical strength isn't that great, but at least he won't fall for a woman. Jake stretched out his hand.

Whoops!

“I got it!”

Jake grabbed Lyla's arm violently. Ash Wick raised a fist as he pulled her arm.

'If you eat just one, you can win!'

Whoo!

Jake clenched his fist. The target was Lyla's face.

Jawick thought he would soon be able to see her bloody and distorted face. And I thought that I would be engulfed in embarrassment and fear now.

So he looked straight into Lyla's face.

was laughing

'uh?'

In an instant, Lyla's head disappeared from his view. Naturally, Jawick's fist cleaved the air.

'Where… .'

The moment I had that question.

Whoops!

“Ok!”

My eyes fluttered at the pain I felt in my cheeks. The body spins and turns, and the view continues to illuminate the ceiling and the floor.

But in the meantime, Lyla's face came in. He was looking at himself pathetic as he retrieved his outstretched fist.

dump!

fell straight down

The hall was quiet once again. If the previous silence was about witnessing a high level of magic, now it was the silence that was caused by not accepting the sudden situation.

match! match! match!

A quiet applause echoed through the silence.

“Also, Lyla. You put the counter right away. Anchovy-like bastards who only sell magic are not opponents you can beat with your bare hands. I also taught you well.”

“Wow!”

Jake shook his head. His cheeks were full. Lyla's fist went in properly. He got up and grabbed the ball.

Lyla strode forward in front of him.

“Ordinary magic duels would have been about winning the match only with magic. After all, the duel in the tower is something different.”

Wow!

An ominous sound echoed from her fingers. Jake flinched.

“It got a little fun.”

two

Lyla threw her wand aside. It was a wand she had never used before, but she could only remember one reason why she threw it.

fighting with fists.

“Come on, wait… !”

It was time for Jawick to shout something.

fault!

Lyla slammed the ground. And he raised his fists.

“ね!”

Jake covered his face with both arms. But again, he was devoted only to magic. The form was so awkward.

Whoops!

“Hey heck!”

Lyla's fist pierced her exposed stomach. His arms spread out spontaneously, revealing Jae Wick's face. Lyla's arm moved like a flash of light again.

Whoops!

“Khehe!”

His head bounced heavily, and Jae-Wick staggered backwards. Lila clicked her tongue.

“I can’t be like Zee. It doesn’t end in one shot.”

“If you can be like me, then I should be embarrassed.”

said Jack.

“Well, I can’t help it.”

Lyla muttered as she saw Jaewick bleeding from her lips.

“If one room doesn’t work, we have no choice but to put two or three rooms together.”

“Come on, wait!”

But this time, Lyla ignored Jake's words. She ran to Jae Wick again. and clenched his fist.

puck! puck!

Continuing, Lyla's fists slam Jawick. Jaywick was busy blocking, dodging, and getting hit.

'Wow, what kind of wizard... !'

In the storm of Nanta, Jawick shouted inwardly.

Lyla didn't learn any great martial arts. In any case, she is an orthodox wizard.

But her physical performance was very good. As much as the old Zich was amazed. Moreover, to some extent, the basics of martial arts were known as knowledge.

In addition, although it is not now, when he joined Sieg, it was training in the early days, and he had a history of rolling as badly as Hans and Snock by Sieg.

There are orthodox mages whose opponents do not use their bodies well, and there are also mages with little experience.

When those conditions came together, the result was that Laila unilaterally grabbed her opponent.

perok

“Heh heh!”

Once again, Jaewick's face bounced back. Suddenly, his face was covered with blood.

“Are you going to surrender?”

She paused the attack for a moment and said.

“It’s a magic duel by the way!”

The pronunciation is still quite clear. Lyla said absurdly.

“Who punched first? So I thought that the magic duel in the tower would be fine. Wasn't it?"

“Wow!”

Jawick stared at Lyla as if to kill him, then suddenly ran back. Lila stared at it silently.

Jake ran to where his staff was. He hurriedly grabbed his wand and headed towards her.

“How can you be stubborn? Alright then. I will make a decision with magic as you think.”

Lyla said, heading to where her wand was.

“However, this one is going to be a little risky. greenhorn."

(Continued on next page)

# No. 236 screen

It was Jae-Week that started singing first. It was only natural that he ran away from the fight with Laila in a hurry and picked up the staff first.

But that wasn't to say that Jawick could use magic first.

"L! Win! Deon! Roise!”

Jake widened his eyes. The same goes for the onlookers and Elena.

So far, it has shown an extraordinary

This time, Lyla really shows off her magic in the form of an orthodox wizard that people think of.

Unless it's a duel with an out-of-standard monster such as Lyla, a normal duel between wizards is determined by the speed of chanting and the use of magical powers.

In short, whoever uses the magic faster will determine the victory.

Of course, there are some people who dodge the opponent's magic and chant while avoiding the opponent's magic like Jake did, and even if they use magic late, they crush the opponent's magic with the power of magic. It is advantageous.

Therefore, the chanting and magic operation are important in the duel of wizards, and people admired the chanting of Jae Week.

However, Lyla's chanting was different. Her lips are sweet, and sentences without meaning to ordinary people are pouring out.

Its speed was obviously much faster than Jaewick. Pronunciation is accurate, so the magic does not stop.

In addition, Lyla, who had been using powerful magic with no chanting, began to memorize the chant in earnest.

The magic to prepare could not be just that kind of magic.

Aww!

A fireball is created above Lyla's staff. The size and the amount of magical power it possesses are strong enough to make the magics that Jieweek used as a joke.

Jaywick, who was singing the chants, opened his mouth. The chant was cut off, and the gathered magic was scattered.

“Uh, uh… !”

I got goosebumps. If you don't do something, the flames in front of you are likely to burn yourself.

I quickly tried to sing again. However, in embarrassment, he could not recite a few letters and the singing stopped again.

Goosebumps all over his body as a fireball sprinkling overwhelming power in front of him.

“Aren’t you going to sing?”

Lila asks. Naturally, her chanting was cut off, but her magic was still there.

'Stop singing!'

Now it's not surprising. It is rather strange that a person who even sings without singing can't stop singing.

“Or what? did you give up? Then you know what to do?”

surrender. One of two conditions to end the match.

However, Jake did not let go of his mouth.

"•••okay."

Lyla's eyes grew cold.

“If it’s your will, then there’s nothing you can do.”

If you don't surrender, you have only one option left. Making the opponent incapacitated.

Lyla sang the chant.

Whoops!

The fireball burns even more intensely. The spectators roared at the sight.

“If you get hit like that, isn’t your inability to fight the problem?”

“I think my body will burn without a trace.”

“Can you withstand the barrier?”

Elena also tugged on the hem of Zich's clothes to see if she was worried.

“I, there. If that's the case, will Mr. Jaewick be okay?"

"yes I'm fine."

Elena sighed in relief.

Also, her teacher seemed to have an idea. I thought that way until Zich continued.

“It will burn cleanly, so you won’t have to go through the trouble of cleaning up the body.”

"•••Yes?"

The sound was off and there was a beep. Zich ignored Elena, who was staring at her with a bewildered look.

Lyla's chanting is over. Until then, Jaewick continued to fail to sing.

“Your heart doesn’t change?”

"Now," said Lyla, who made a fireball that could easily be swallowed by five or six people.

“Come on, wait… !”

"okay. You were really annoying, but I commend you for your courage. It would be rude to give a thumbs up to a guy like you.”

“So wait… !”

“If you survive, I hope you will change your attitude of ignoring others from then on.”

Coolly ignoring Jawick's words, Laila moved her wand. The fireball also moved along with the staff.

“Uh, huh?”

“Gee, are you really shooting?”

"for a moment! If you hit that, it's a potion and you can't use it for anything!"

First of all, the minimum safety device is the duel they were doing. However, Lyla's magic was not a magic that could explain the minimum safety device.

Whoops!

But relentlessly the magic was fired.

In Jaewick's eyes, he sees a fireball approaching more and more. The scorching heat drew near. As expected, the moment of death approached right before my eyes.

“Hey, hang-boo oooooooo!”

his throat burst and shouted. However, the fireball has already left Lyla's control. It seemed that Jaewick's body was about to burn at any moment.

A shadow broke in front of him.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

The fireball exploded. A roar struck the arena. However, that was the only damage the fireball did to the surroundings.

Whoa!

The flames that spread in all directions stopped and were sucked into the center. The light flickers as it is a great regret that nothing was burned. But there was no further resistance.

Kwajik!

His fists are clenched, and the gathered flames are scattered. With that, the fireball that Lyla had created disappeared neatly.

Jawick stared blankly at the person standing in front of him.

“It doesn’t look like there are any injuries.”

With the Windur he used to cut the fireballs back on his back, Zich looked at Jake.

"iced coffee… .”

“Um, are you out of your mind? Well, just don't do that. So why didn't you surrender a little earlier? If it weren't for me, you'd be just a pile of charcoal, a  pile of charcoal  ."

Zich patted Jawick on the cheek. However, Jake did not react much.

“So now it’s my turn?”

I don't know what the man in front of me is talking about.

“You said you were going to a duel with me.”

Jake's eyes fluttered.

“When are you going to do it? next now? Or today? tomorrow?"

“Or why not just do it?”

At that moment, Jake nodded slightly.

"okay. well thought out It's me to beat a dog with a tail down like a dog, but you don't seem worth it."

Despite the insulting remarks, Jake didn't say anything.

He looked smart. How easily he smashed the magic flame that was flying towards him and he could never help it.

“From now on, I will be a little more careful.

If you go around arguing with anyone like that and then meet really bad people, that's when you'll turn into a lump of charcoal."

Zich stood up and looked at the spectators.

"then! Does anyone else have any dissatisfaction with my beautiful close friend becoming Miss Dwayne's teacher?”

No one had an open mouth.

"like. I am glad that your misunderstandings about my close friend have been cleared up. So I hope you don’t mind us in the future.”

Zich turned his back. He approached Laila, who was still standing in the arena, and spread her palms.

"great job."

“What is the trouble?”

But even so, Lila raised her hand and touched Zich's palm.

“Then is this ridiculous thing over?”

“Are you really good at saying things like that?”

“How painful it is when the wizard’s fist hurts.”

It was like saying he would die of embarrassment if he heard it.

“Once you beat it up a bit, did it go as planned?”

“For now, that’s it.”

“I hope it goes well.”

“Don’t talk like other people. Aren't you involved too?"

Lila snorted.

“Anyway, can we focus on education for the time being?”

"right. Pan grew up and made a fuss. Now we have to see how the tall people in the tower come out.”

Thus, the commotion surrounding the tower came to an end.


A few days have passed since Lyla's duel. Zich and Lyla stopped by the tower as usual to teach Elena.

However, the reaction of the magicians of the tower to them was markedly different from before. The line of gaze, which had been mixed with curiosity and contempt, was completely replaced by fear and reverence.

'I have no  choice but to do that  .'

Zich felt the gazes and smiled. No matter how the ranks of the tower were determined by the rank or school of the tower, as long as the magicians of the tower were people who gathered for magic, the treatment of outstanding magicians was of course high. Moreover, Matop is a meritocracy organization.

The eyes of the people around them move as Laila walks next to Zich. But Lyla didn't pay any attention to that gaze.

'I really fell in love with teaching.'

She was chatting happily with Elena. It seemed almost out of my mind that this was part of the plan.

'Well, I have to tell you to enjoy it to the fullest.'

Just because she offered to help him, he did not intend to wield her at will.

'At least that level of stress should be relieved so that I can help you feel better later.'

And anyway, there is no reason to move violently now.

'Rumors are going well, so now the upper heads of the tower will move in some way.'

And that includes Zich's goals, Wilwes Dwayne and Orland Dwayne.

it will be

The top of the tower belongs to the owner of the tower, Wilwes Dwayne. The fact that the entire top floor of the tower was used was an indicator of how great the prestige of the master in the tower was.

On one side of the top floor was a conference room. Regularly, ten of the most outstanding wizards, including the master of Magic Tower, gather at Mato and have a meeting about the current situation and the future direction of Mato.

“Then, today’s meeting will end with this.”

The tension in the conference room eased when Wilwes said that the meeting was over as mate.

“Hey, waist!”

“This is true! As I get older, even a monthly meeting is difficult.”

The wizards stretched out and started chatting. It was always after the meeting was over.

If the meeting so far was a public event, the Saddam after the meeting is a private conversation between high-ranking wizards.

The wizard next to him spoke to Wilwes as well.

“I heard rumors that the granddaughter of Master Matap had hired a new teacher.”

“Ah, that’s it. I heard it too.”

The one who answered was a magician other than the master mage. Other wizards also showed red beauty. Now that story was the most famous story in the Ma Tower.

“The child of the Zawick family was humiliated in a duel.”

“Okay!”

Someone made a sound of pain. It was Wayne Jawick, the grandfather of Jack Ma, and the head of the Zawick family.

“It was a good thing. Still, he was a guy who lived for his good taste, saying he was a little better than his peers. Besides, it is unforgivable to use the arena on your own terms without permission. It would have been a good study to have tasted it once.”

But Wayne Jawick's expression didn't look good when he said that.

No matter how much Jack Ma had argued first, he was still his grandson.

That's why others didn't mention Jack Ma no longer.

Sanctions have already been put in place for him. He could no longer damage his colleague's face.

Besides, they weren't even interested in Mar Win Zawick anyway.

“You said your name was Lyla, didn’t you?”

"Yes. He's not our magician. Let’s call him a wandering wizard.”

“But I heard that his skills are not normal.”

“All I have heard so far is that it is possible to use the chorus without chanting and the chorus stop. Besides, I heard that the last chanting magic was a fairly high-level magic.”

The wizards exchange information about Lyla that they have heard from each other.

Wilwes Dwayne, the owner of the tower, and Orland Dwayne, who was already here at a young age, watched it quietly.

(Continued on next page)

The story of the wizards continued.

“I heard you are very young.”

"Must have at best a Appearances 10 at about half after 20 yo deogun seems early for."

"her! At that age, he had already accomplished that much magic. Geniuses are usually not geniuses.”

“You may be older than you look.”

“Even 30's are fast enough.”

“If that’s enough, how about scouting with a horse tower?”

“It's worth a try. A talented person like that would be of great help to the tower.”

The more you talk, the more Laila's value soars. But there were those who didn't like it.

A prime example is Wayne Jawick. His small, fuzzy cheeks represented his feelings. However, the wizards who were engrossed in the story could not see his expression.

Some noticed, but ignored them. Just by not bringing up his son's story, he was respectful to him.

But there was another person who seemed to have bad feelings for Lyla.

"If you're that good of a wizard, maybe you can really help Elena."

“Nonsense.”

The left became silent. People followed the source of the unpleasant voice.

The place their eyes touched was the seat of the most supreme chief, Ma Thap-ju.

“No matter how good a magician teaches, he cannot create magical powers that are not there. You are blowing even more wind into a child who has had a bad wind.”

People looked into each other's eyes. It seemed that Ma Thap-Ju did not like the fact that Lyla was teaching Elena.

“•••Well, it is.”

“Honestly, isn’t it the Master of Martial who taught Elena? No matter how talented a man named Lyla may be, I cannot imagine that he will surpass Ma Thapju. But how can she succeed in a job that even the master of ma tap could not do? I think it is impossible.”

“I think we were too excited to see a genius.”

There was also the fact that Ma Thap-ju noticed, but when he calmed his excitement, he didn't even think that Elena's education would be successful.

Wayne Jawick nodded eagerly. Rather than agreeing with others' opinions, I liked that the value of Lyla, which had soared high in the sky, fell.

At that time, there were words that went directly against the planting of the Master Ma Thap.

“How are you?”

Everyone's eyes turned to the owner of the voice.

“Isn’t that what a child wants? The child is still young. It's not bad to try to do what you want to do. If you can release the magic, that's good, but if you don't, can it get any worse? Rather, it is better to challenge yourself like that, and to convince yourself and fold it.”

“•••So you mean to watch the child continue to suffer, Orland!”

Orland shook his head at Willwes's howl.

“Where in the world is there a father who enjoys the suffering of his daughter? But if I gave up my magic to Elena now, it would be much more painful. Even his father knows his love for magic.”

“That’s why I have to quit now! You know when that child will convince you! It is most effective to break the pain quickly and bury it in time! Are you going to become a parent, take it, and throw your child into a thorny path?”

“… Assist your child as much as possible

That’s what parents do.”

“If the road is cut off in the middle, it is the parent’s job to guide them along the other way!”

The rich man's words and deeds became more and more harsh. The wizards around were bewildered.

“I tell you, I was not a very good wizard when I was young! Rather, it is a case that has seen the light of its size! Why don't you admit that Elena can too!"

“Weren’t you still standing at the starting line? Elena isn't even that! As long as you give up your magic, Elena will be able to thrive in other ways! And a case like yours is not common!”

“… is it so. That’s why he did it to me too.”

“Why are you talking about yourself here again?”

“Do you not think that the child is a shame for the family? Because of that, I quickly gave up on magic… .”

quaang

The master smashed the table hard.

“What did you say now?”

Orland didn't answer. But looking straight into Wilwes's eyes didn't seem like it would bite him.

“Come on, stop. What is this! Even if this is a private place to build our friendship, it is not a place for a fight between the rich!”

The second rank of wizard, just below the mage, stopped Wilwes. And he rebuked Orland.

“And Orland Dwayne. No matter how angry you are, what do you mean to your father!”

“••• Excuse me. You looked ugly. I apologize.”

Orland got up and bowed his head around him.

But he thoroughly avoided Wilwes's direction. And Wilwes still couldn't hide his angry eyes.

It is difficult to continue Saddam in such a heavy atmosphere. People looked away and scattered.

After that, rumors from the bottom of the tower began to spread.

The conflict between Wilwes and Orland over Elena is more serious than expected.

Zich often roamed the tower while Lyla was teaching Elena. It was usually Lyla's errand.

Laila often told Zich to buy something from Matop's shop.

Mostly it was a snack that she and Elena ate during their break.

Elena was sorry, but Zich didn't care.

'Because I can hear rumors like this.'

Zich stood up as he waited for the golden-roasted smokes to be packed. Magic power gathered in his ear, and his still strong hearing grew stronger.

'I can't even hear sounds from other floors.'

Is it really called a magic tower? The only thing that could be heard about what kind of treatment was taken when building the hemp tower was the sound of being in the same room.

But that alone allowed Zich to hear an interesting conversation.

“Did you hear me? I heard that Master Matap and Orland Dwayne had a fight after the meeting.”

“For what? You two are rich. What to fight... . Ah! Maybe Elena Dwayne?”

"right. This time, Elena Dwayne hired a new teacher.”

“I saw it myself. It was really great. A wizard is good at punching, and his magic skills don't seem to be pushed even by the top of the Magic Tower? Besides being young and pretty!”

“But it seems that Matthew didn’t like it very much.”

"Because it's a pretty well-known fact that he doesn't like Elena Dwayne's magic lessons."

"On the other hand, Orland Dwayne-sama fully supports Elena Dwayne's magic study."

“Oh, so did Elena Dwayne have a new, capable teacher that sparked a new rift between them?”

"right. After the meeting, looking at the quarrel in the presence of other people, it seems that the conflict is quite deep.”

Zich smiled brightly. They talked more, but there was no more nutritious information.

'For once, it's definitely having an impact.'

If the two of them had a fight even at the meeting of the tower, surely each other's feelings would be hurt as much as they did.

'At the same time, curiosity about Lyla will soar.'

A young genius wizard who suddenly appeared in the tower. A person who teaches magic to their daughter or granddaughter.

Whether that's good or bad, I can't help but be interested.

'I'll call Lyla soon.'

Then, think about what kind of person they are.

When the order came out, Zich bought it and another large drink and went up to Laila and Elena.

And as Zich had expected, a few days later, he received a call saying he wanted to see Laila.

It was Elena's father, Orland Dwayne, who moved first.

A small sound of horseshoes is heard over the carriage. As a result, the carriage slowly sways.

Thanks to the well-paved road and the performance of the luxurious carriage, the shaking was not so great.

Zich and Lyla were sitting side by side in the carriage. Across from them sat Elena.

They were on their way to Orland's mansion at his invitation.

Elena looked a little nervous. He was a little afraid of what his new teacher and father's meeting would be like.

As a father who supports her study of magic, it may not seem like a big deal, but if even her father's opinion changes, she really has to study with no one to rely on.

Of course, she had no option to quit studying magic.

'I'll be fine.'

I try to reflect on myself like that, but the tension doesn't go away.

'I'm also worried about Mr. Zeek.'

A friend of a teacher who always treats himself kindly. However, considering his previous duel with Jawick, he was by no means a kind person.

But anyway, just worrying about it doesn't mean anything will happen. She took a deep breath.

“Are you nervous?”

“… Yes, a little.”

At Zich's question, Elena frankly nodded her head. Lyla said with a soft smile.

"do not worry. I’m nervous because it’s difficult to just go and say hello as a teacher.”

"okay. And when we heard the rumors, he said that your father was in favor of your magic study.”

"Yes."

If you think that way, it is again. However, when I heard that he was a father who was in favor of studying magic, my grandfather who was against the study of magic came to mind one after another, and I was a little stunned.

“If you are so worried, why don’t you explain to me just for a moment what kind of person your father is? If you know a certain amount of information, you can tailor it appropriately.”

At Zich's explanation, Elena began to explain, thinking that it would be better.

“Your name is Orland Dwayne. He is also the head of the Conrod School, a large school in the Ma Tower.”

“I heard that you and your grandfather are of different schools.”

"that's right. In fact, the Conrod School is my mother’s school.”

Elena's mother. A new character appeared. Zich's eyes lit up a little.

“At the time, my father was not a very promising person. My grandfather also said that he thought his father was not a person who could achieve great success through magic. My father wanted to find some other way, so he followed his mother to the Conrode School.”

“And did you do great?”

Elena nodded her head.

“It is often said. He is someone who doesn’t match his aptitude and school.”

“For example, in what way?”

"My grandfather's school, the Fleur school, are special in flame-based magic."

Jack nodded inwardly. Before the return, Elena's specialty was flame-based magic.

“But the Conrod School, the school of my father and mother, is the exact opposite. His specialty is ice and snow magic.”

"indeed. It sounds like your aptitude was the complete opposite.”

"Yes."

“Excuse me, but what about your mother?”

“He is dead.”

“You asked an rude question.”

Zich shook her head lightly, and Elena waved her hand.

"no. It's okay now that I've gotten rid of it to some extent."

“Then, can you think of your father as a promising wizard who mainly uses ice and snow?”

Lyla quickly changed the topic by asking the next question.

" Yes."

“Has Ms Dwayne never studied with another school? A different path could have been more appropriate, like my father.”

“That’s when you have a certain amount of magical power. A man of Dwayne's age who couldn't unleash his magical powers would not have been accepted by any school."

“Your teacher is right.”

"Right."

While we were talking, the carriage entered a mansion.

As a person who was recognized for his ability to participate in important meetings of the tower even at a young age, Orland's mansion was large and splendid.

After getting out of the carriage, Zee and his party headed to the restaurant under the guidance of the users.

"welcome."

The person sitting at the top stood up and said. The owner of this mansion was Orland Dwayne.

"dad!"

“How are you, Elena?”

Smiling at his daughter, he walks out. Elena snuggled into his arms.

“You look healthy. I guess it's because I'm enjoying my new study, right?"

"Yes!"

She answered with a bright smile. It was Elena Dwayne's appearance as a daughter, the first time Zich and Lyla, who thought they had become very close recently, saw each other.

“It's really fun! Teachers teach well too! Oh, let me introduce you to the teacher!”

Elena got out of Orland's arms and came to Lyla's side.

“You are my father.”

“My name is Orland Dwayne. As a father, thank you so much for taking care of my daughter.”

“My name is Lyla. Miss Dwayne is a great disciple. He has quick comprehension and excellent memorization. You must be very happy as a father.”

"haha! A very proud daughter.”

Orland, who puts his hand on Elena's shoulder and spoke, seemed to be able to see even the so-called idiot who loved her daughter a lot.

“But the person next to you

“It’s called Zich. Lyla's close friend. Today, I followed Lyla as an escort.”

“He is a person who often helps in class.”

Elena added.

"i See. Oh, you've kept the guests standing for too long. Please sit this way.”

Following Orland's guidance, people were seated. Orland, the owner of the house, sat at the top, and Elena sat to the right of it. Lyla sat across from Elena, and Zich sat next to him.

Orland gave the signal and the food started coming out. They were pretty good food. People picked up the tableware and began to savor the food in front of them.

Orland and Elena were slightly surprised to see Zich and Lyla eating. Neither of them had a break in meal etiquette.

'Aren't you two just wandering around? After all, there are no teachers who use that level of magic, or Mr. Zich who easily blocks the teacher's magic, or ordinary people.'

Rather, it was more convincing that they were people with a story.

Orland seemed to have the same thoughts as Elena.

“You both have good dining etiquette.”

“I learned it by coming and going.”

“I had the opportunity to learn before.”

However, when Zich and Laila's answers did not come from God, they knew that they were reluctant to discuss the topic, so they changed the topic.

Orland looked at Elena.

“Did you say your studies are going well?”

"Yes!"

“Are there any hints that the magic will be released?”

Elena's face, who had been smiling until now, hardened. That alone was enough to answer.

“Not yet.”

“… Yes."

Orland turned to Lyla.

“How are you, sir? Do you see any signs of awakening Elena's magical powers?"

" no."

Lyla's firm answer is heard. But instead of dying of grass, Elena relaxed her face.

“But I already knew that it was not easy. With that in mind, I said I would teach, and Elena said that I would learn. How long may I be able to teach Elena, but until then, I will do my best.”

Lyla smiles softly at Elena.

“Elena won’t give up either.”

"Sure!"

Hearing Lyla's words, Elena nodded her head.

“•••Elena's determination is much stronger than I thought. As a father, I thought that I understood my daughter to some extent, but I guess I was also a little biased. great. If this is what you and Elena think, I will fully support you.”

After saying that, Orland said to Elena.

“Do whatever you want, whether it results in results or your own conclusions. Grandpa's pinned cup will not be blocked by this father. Whatever you do, it doesn’t matter if you come into this house.”

“Thank you, Dad!”

Elena held her father's hand, who was always on her side.

“Still, I want to stay at Grandpa’s house. Even though you look displeased, it's still the same as cherishing me. Grandpa’s house is comfortable.”

"okay. If you think so, then why not?”

And Orland continued the conversation with the guests.

Most of them asked how Elena was taking classes. And as a senior wizard and parent, I asked him to give me strength in a certain field. And I talked a little bit with Elena.

The rest was about personal curiosity, such as where Laila learned magic, or a recommendation not to enter the tower.

Lyla answered that she was self-taught about magic, and refused to enter the tower.

Orland was very surprised to hear that Lyla had learned magic on her own, and was very sad when she refused her invitation to enter the tower.

But it was not strongly recommended.

So after some time has passed. Meal time is over.

Orland went out to meet him outside the building to see off the departing Zee.

“Please take good care of my daughter in the future.”

Orland, who greeted Lyla first and then Zich, also hugged Elena.

“Work hard. Understand?"

"Yes!"

So dinner with Orland ended.

The three returned in Orland's wagon as they had come. Elena, who is close to the house, got off first and got off in front of the dormitory, Zich and Laila.

"how was it? Orland.”

At Lila's question, Zich stroked his chin.

“Suspicious.”

“Is there anything suspicious?”

Lyla asked surprised. She found no accusations against Orland.

“I thought he was a kind and caring person. Even when I was young, I was given the title of teacher. Besides , I will  do my best to make  my daughter's dream come true  .

Aren’t you a very nice person as a father when you see them cheering for you?”

“So you are winning. You seem like such a nice person. Originally, people like that had a handful of plans...”

tl •

“Hey!”

He tapped Zich's forearm, and Lyla entered the dormitory. Zich quickly followed her.

“Anyway, thinking about… .”

“There are actually a lot of those guys. You act as if you are a good human being on the outside, and then you do dirty things on the back.”

“You're not just being grumpy, are you?”

“I can’t say it doesn’t exist.”

Jack giggled. But the mischievous laughter soon turned into a serious face.

“As you said, there are no serious charges. There are only a few things that make it a bit suspicious if I force it to work with Elena.”

“••• Was there anything like that?”

Lyla rolled her eyes. Honestly, it seemed like he couldn't keep up with Zich in this respect.

“Once you hear Orland and Elena talk, the reason Elena didn’t give up her magic was like her father.”

“Is that weird? Orland Dwayne is the only person who supports Elena's magic study, as most wizards in the Tower know.”

“It’s different, Lyla. Daughter dreams  as something that not chasing daughter got one thing stark differences that encourage chasing a dream. "

“You mean Orland Dwayne made up Elena’s unwillingness to give up her magic?”

“It is not definitive. Because I only felt that way in a subtle way in their conversation. Besides, even if it were, it wouldn't be that outright. Elena's intentions must have been cleverly mixed with her own intentions. Of course, for an immature child, that level of induction would have been enough.”

“… Are you there again?”

“There was something strange about Elena’s conversation about education. Elena's magic is the problem, but other magical achievements are genius, right?"

Lyla nodded her head.

“But I didn’t really care about magic. At least I could ask for an opinion on how to release the magic. Conversely, he showed great interest in Elena's magical achievements except for magical powers. He even reflected his opinions saying that it would be better to raise one himself first.”

Saying that is an award. But Lila shook her head.

“That’s something that a father can do. Magical power is Elena's weakness, so she deliberately avoided that topic. The other magical achievements are areas where Elena can be confident enough, so focus on that area and raise Elena's spirit. Suggesting an educational policy is something I can do with great importance as a father and a high-level wizard. With that in mind, I only see Orland Dwayne as a good father.”

"right."

Jack didn't really object.

“So you said it. The point is that it might be a little suspicious if you force it. But Lyla.”

Zich put a finger in front of Lyla's face.

“When there are not many clues like now, this trivial fact, ‘Isn’t it a bit suspicious if you think about it this way’ can be a clue to the solution. Of course, you don't have to take it seriously. But it’s worth shoving it into your brain.”

It wasn't wrong, so Lila nodded her head innocently.

“By the way, why don’t you sneak in this time? I thought you were going to go to sleep right away when you took Wilwes Dwayne and Orlando Dwayne as suspects.”

Lyla recalled the days of Albas Winpple and Renuent Deras.

“At that time, it was urgent. You had to take some risks. But even though Elena Dwayne is a little stressed out right now, it's not urgent. The two suspects are praying.”

“Then, are you planning on collecting clues steadily this time?”

“Where is it decided? You have to judge the situation and decide what to do at that time. If the situation is urgent, you can go to sleep at any time.”

Zich looked to where the horse tower was.

“Still, the tower is a difficult place for me to infiltrate with my skills right now, so I hope you can find a clue if you can.”

Just one day after Orland Dwayne's invitation. This time, Zich's party was invited by Wilwes Dwayne.

At the invitation, Elena looked very nervous.

The person he saw this time was not his father, who favored his magic study, but his grandfather, who was not favorable to him. Lyla comforted her. And I gladly accepted the invitation.

That evening. Zich and Lyla were standing in their new mansion.

“You are Elena’s teacher.”

Wilwes, who had basic manners, but was full of disdain in the light of his eyes, greeted them.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 239 screen

The dining room wasn't as bad as expected. Wilwes greeted Zich and the others with courtesy.

To Zich and Lyla, if not respectful, they attached the anti-joon band to each other and called Lyla a teacher like Orland did.

Elena, who had been crooked, opened the door little by little as the dinner table flowed smoothly.

'If it's not about magic, the relationship between grandchildren and grandchildren seems to be very good.'

Zich remembered Elena telling Orland not to leave her grandfather's house.

'Well, if my relationship with my grandfather was the worst, there's no reason to stay in this house. If I live in my father's house, that's enough.'

According to Elena's story, Orlando originally lived in Willwes's house.

However, when Orland moved to another school, they naturally separated, and Elena stayed with Wilwess because she had been studying the Flu school all along.

In a normal family, children would follow their parents, but this was a phenomenon that occurred because the Dwayne family was not a normal family, but a wizarding family.

The main dishes passed and the desserts started coming out.

Orland hasn't talked about sensitive things until now, but the reason he called Lyla is because of Elena's magic study.

In the end, a serious story had to come out.

“How is my granddaughter studying?”

Elena's body stiffened. It felt like a light hiccup.

“It’s going well. Miss Dwayne is a very good kid. The speed of absorbing knowledge is definitely unique.”

"exactly?"

No matter how opposed to the study of magic, a happy emotion flashed across Willwes's face, as if he could not hear even the praise of his granddaughter offended.

But that was only for a moment. Wilwes hardened his face.

“How about the most important magic power?”

“Not yet.”

Lyla replied calmly. For a moment there was silence in the room.

Wilwes sighed lightly.

“I believe you already know my position. Whether Elena said it or not, it's a famous story in Snoowick."

“Yes, I heard.”

“Then I think you’ll know what I’m going to tell you from now on.”

“Are you telling me to stop teaching Elena?”

Wilwes relaxed his body and pressed his eyes tightly shut. He, who had exuded a gentle dignity as a mage master and head of the Flew School, now seemed just an ordinary grandfather who cared for his granddaughter.

“Are you two lovers?”

Wilwes looked at Zich and Lyla and asked. The two answered immediately.

"no."

"no."

"exactly? They seem to get along well with each other.”

Zich grinned and Lila sighed.

“Then do you have a lover?”

“Neither.”

Jack replied.

“You two will find out when they fall in love, get married, and have children. Raising children is usually not a difficult task.”

Wilwes took a sip of the tea that came with the dessert.

“I will ask the teacher. Is the path of magic easy?”

“Not at all.”

Without a single hesitation, Lila shook her head.

Although she knows a lot of magic knowledge and skillfully uses everything related to magic from chanting to magic circles, she could not say that the path of magic was difficult, but never easy.

And it was the same with Willwes, who has become the master of Snoowick, who has been walking the path of magic for the rest of his life and is respected by all.

“So am I. People talk about me like a master of magic, but to me, I'm just a dipper in the sea of ​​magic. The study of magic is that deep and vast.”

Lyla nodded in agreement with Wilwess.

“People around me called me a genius, and I also think I am a genius. The environment was affluent, and studying magic was fun. But even so, it was very difficult to walk the path of magic.”

"I understand."

“By the way, Can you recommend to your granddaughter on such a difficult road?”

Wilwes spoke gloomy.

“The two of you might look at me and think of me as a fucking old man who doesn’t care about his granddaughter’s feelings and only insists on his own opinions.”

“I really don’t think so… .”

“If you don’t, thank you. No matter how you look at it, my son seems to think so.”

Lyla smiled bitterly.

“But I mean. I want you to know why I think so. It's okay to say things like this, but our Dway family is a prestigious song recognized by Snoowick. Among the ancestors, there are many who were in charge of the matap master. Naturally, our descendants have walked the path of magic and will continue to do so. If my descendants are interested in magic and show passion, they push me and they push me, but they won’t stop me.”

But he blocked Elena's way.

“Teacher, how many times do you think Elena will release her magical powers from now on?”

“I don’t know for sure, but it must be extremely low.”

"exactly. Even if you have great talent, it is difficult to go through the path of magic. How can the path be so simple without the magical powers that are the root of magic in one place? It's like charging in front of a million troops on the battlefield without spears, swords, bows, armor, or even a single stone. As a grandfather and as a protector, I couldn’t leave it alone.”

“But Elena wants it.”

"right. A young man running his dreams can hardly be stopped. I did too when I was young, but I'm too old. Because of that, young people who are like flames will not be able to understand. So is my son. If Elena had only a little bit of magic power, I would have thought the same thing.”

However, Elena did not have the magical power that was an essential element of a wizard.

“I have achieved everything I wanted to achieve. Now all he wants is for Elena to be happy. I can do anything for Elena as long as I give up my magic. If he wants to study other things, I will support him, and if he opens a store, I will open up. If you want to get married, find the best groom.”

His skills, power, and status are sufficient things to do.

“But not just magic. If Elena makes another choice, I have no intention of stopping her from studying magic as a hobby. But targeting magic is the opposite.”

“Helena is happy to study magic.”

“There is no guarantee that the feeling will last forever. Efforts that are not rewarded are always difficult. But have you done it all your life? It's not happiness, it's torture."

Wilwes said firmly.

“Then, can it be said that Dwayne-sama will continue to oppose Miss Dwayne’s study of magic?”

"exactly."

“Then you want me to get rid of Miss Dwayne?”

Wilwes looked at Elena. She had an anxious look. Wilwes sighed once more.

“Even if I say so, neither Elena nor the teacher seem to have any intention of doing that.”

"Yes."

“Why don’t you turn around and talk over there? Please think about the back of the old man for a moment.”

Wilwes shook his head.

“I heard you are a traveler. How long are you going to stay in this city?”

“It has not been decided yet. But it won't stay that long.”

" Right."

Wilwes looked at Elena.

"I'm still against you studying magic."

“… Yes."

“But as a grandfather, it’s a little bit different to keep kicking your granddaughter’s wishes. Only this one time.”

Elena's eyes widened.

“I just learned magic from this teacher. When the teacher leaves the city, I will stop you from studying magic again.”

"grandfather!"

Elena jumped into Wilwes' arms.

An expression of disapproval overflowed Willwes's face. However, there was nothing he could do about the arc that slowly appeared on his lips. But the words that came out were still blunt.

“Don’t like it. As I just said, it is only until the teacher leaves the city.”

“Thank you for that alone.”

Wilwes patted her granddaughter on the back as if she couldn't help it.

Seeing that, Laila said playfully.

“You are not making any conditions. If it doesn't work, it's like I have to quit magic after I'm gone."

“I don’t want to make my granddaughter a liar.”

Even if they put such a condition, it was said that Elena would not keep her promise. But seeing how humble Elena was, it didn't seem like Wilwes was wrong either.

Lyla smiled softly.

“You are a good grandfather.”

“What kind of grandfather is a good old man who is against good granddaughter?”

Wilwes waved his hand.

“Anyway, I won’t be comfortable with this for the time being. No fights with my granddaughter. Oh, I see, sir. Do you have any plans to come to our tower?”

Lyla blinked at the rather random suggestion.

“It’s sudden. But if I put enemies in the tower, will I continue to teach Elena?”

“Ah, that’s right.”

Wilwes frowned as if he didn't realize that.

“But as a mage owner, I can’t help but scout a wizard like you.”

Wilwes groaned in pain and fell into anguish. Laila's playful question seemed to be a very difficult problem for him.

"Do not worry. I have no intention of going into the tower.”

“… I don't know if I should be happy or sad."

Wilwes said shakily.

After dinner, Zich and his party left Dwayne's mansion.

Elena's expression brightened when she came out to see them off. Even if it was only for a short time, it was only natural that he received the approval of his grandfather.

Zich and Lila got off in front of their dormitory just like the day before. The question Lyla posed was similar to the previous day.

"how was it?"

“Suspicious.”

Jack said seriously. But Laila had a very suspicious look.

“Doesn’t that mean that Wilwes Dwayne is suspicious because he looks like such a good grandfather?”

“Now, how do you read my mind so well?”

Lyla wiped her face with her hand.

“Don’t be kidding, tell me straight away!”

Zich giggled for a moment, then exhaled.

“At first, Wilwes was suspicious. Because Elena was preventing her from studying magic as much as possible.”

“There was a reason. Besides, in today's conversation, we're talking about Elena Dwayne.

A love seemed real.”

“You can’t act like that. How many people have I caught through acting?”

“I think it’s hard to compare with you.”

"Why. Did Wilwes Dwayne's actions seem so sincere? No, rather than that, you didn't want to suspect the grandfather who loved his granddaughter so much, didn't he?"

Lila flinched.

“That’s why you shouldn’t focus on emotions. When someone who people usually think of as a weak person, especially an elderly person, shows emotions, they tend to focus on that person’s emotional line.”

“•••Yes, I am an idiot.”

Lyla, who had nothing to say, snorted.

"But it's strange to suspect that he at best prevented Elena Dwayne from studying magic."

“I was talking about when Gren Gennard was a piece of junk that had to do with the real Rob. Gren Jennerd helps Elena Dwayne, who was in despair because she could not learn magic, and frees her magic. So what about it?”

Lyla rolled her eyes.

“It’s just a novel after all. A novel, not a hypothesis. But when the novel is true, Wilwess trying to stop Lyla from studying magic must be very suspicious.”

When I heard it, it made sense.

“Still, there are no trivial clues, let alone definitive clues. Only a few conjectures close to fiction have been obtained.”

“Then, is the operation of thinking about Willwes Dwayne and Orland Dwayne a failure?”

Just look at the results. But Zeek couldn't say that the results weren't very good. Because Zich had made a very interesting discovery.

'Is that person right?'

Seeing Willwes Dwayne today was a surprise to Zich. It was because the face he had seen for the first time was very familiar to him.

'When I dreamed of being a Brave, I was a wacky magician who played with Leona. You look so much like Wilwes Dwayne.'

as if they were the same person.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 240 screen

'Of course, under the premise that the dream is not a dog dream.'

Zich still wasn't sure if the dream was real. No, rather than not being sure, it would be better to not want to give up hope.

'I hope it's a dog dream... .'

I didn't want to admit that I was the guy named Zich Brave, who acted as if I was some kind of warrior of justice.

However, he did not completely deny the dream just because he did not like it.

Maybe it's because the dream is related to Zich's own return, the knowledge of Lyla and her future, and the conspiracy of Ren Gennard. Due to Zich's personality, he couldn't leave it alone.

'Sometimes I hate this guy's personality. It would be better to ignore this and move on.'

This character who saved his life several times before returning, at least now resented it.

'If that dog dream is true, then Willwes Dwayne is a person you can trust, right?'

He's Brave's mate, so at least he's not a bad guy.

Were not both Rubella and Leona, who were Brave's other colleagues, of good race?

'There is a high possibility that the giant and the wizard are also reliable figures.'

Then there is only one left.

'Is it Orland Dwayne?'

“What do you think?”

Zich woke up from his thoughts at Lyla's voice.

“How am I supposed to frame the two of them… no, the suspect… . No, not even that, I thought I could find a clue…”

“Go in.”

Before she could finish speaking, Lyla turned her back and went into the house.

Zich loudly boos her heartlessness. But even in that playful act, Zich's eyes were very deep.

Elena, who has crossed the barrier of Willwes Dwayne, now has no harshness.

She no longer went to the horse tower. As long as Wilwes had formally allowed Elena to study, there was no need to avoid studying at Dwayne's mansion.

As if to prove that it was the mansion of Ma Tapp, Dwayne's mansion was equipped with a fairly high level of laboratory and training ground.

Of course, it wasn't just a favor to his granddaughter.

Leila, who had given up the task for a while and left Elena, asked Zich.

“Surveillance?”

“Many places.”

As he sips the tea the user gave him, Zich answered.

“After all, the mansion wasn’t just given away as a place for education.”

"of course. I'll give you full confidence when Wilwes Dwayne saw us. Rather, if we left our granddaughter without any means of protection, that would make us question whether the author was sane.”

Lyla nodded her head.

“I, over there.”

An awkward voice was heard. Zich and Lyla's heads turned to the side where the voice was heard.

“Then why did you bring me here?”

Snok, who hesitated while looking around with a puzzled face, was sitting next to Zich.

coo... .

No Webb, who was lying on Snock's shoulder, wept as if agreeing.

“I want you to help Elena’s class.”

Lyla put her hand on Snock's shoulder and said.

After obtaining permission from Wilwes,

At Elena's suggestion, she was calling her by name. It was the same with Jack.

“I am? I don't know much about magic, do I?"

"know. do not worry. Would you like me to teach you magic? To be precise, I need the power of Knowm rather than you.”

coo!

Knowwet, who had been drooping, jumped up and stood on Snok's shoulder. He sees Laila and then he sees Elena.

An old thought flashed through his head.

- No dissection or anything like that... !-

-If I need to dissect a know-how and investigate it, I'll do it!-

woo woo woo!

Now, screaming, sneaked into Snock's robe. Snock also looked at Lyla with trembling.

"what's the matter?"

Lila did not know English. It was Zich's laughter-filled voice that solved her doubts.

“You must have been intimidated by your anatomical luck in the past.”

"Oh. did you still have it in mind? I wonder if I really want to dissect Knowwet.”

Snock calmed down a bit as Lyla patted her hand, and Nowwem poked her face over the hem of her robe. But again, you have to listen to what people say.

"If you don't become an enemy, I'm not going to dissect you."

'I just wanted you to say that the word dissection itself is a joke!'

'Coo!'

One man and one silent scream rang out.

"Teacher! I'm done!”

He ran back and forth like a dog fetching a branch that Elena had thrown away. In her hand was the assignment Lyla had given her.

“Good job. It's also Elena."

Lila smiled brightly.

“Okay, Elena. So, shall we try some real magic now?”

"•••Yes?"

There was a small crack in Elena's smile.

“Teacher, all my magic… .”

“I know. Maybe the teacher forgot it. I brought someone to help.”

“Anyone to help?”

Lyla looks at Snock next to her. Zich also looks at Snok. Naturally, Elena's gaze moved to Snock.

“… Yes'?"

Snock, who suddenly received three pairs of gazes at the same time, was bewildered.

“Your magic power will be in charge of this child.”

"Yes?"

"•••Yes?"

It was Elena who immediately expressed the question. And it was Snock who answered with a blink of an eye a beat later.

“Is there a way to use magic with someone else’s magic?”

Elena, who was educated under Willwes, the owner of the tower, is also hearing about it for the first time.

No, it was an impossible method that Elena knew in the first place. When you use your opponent's magical power to use magic, you can only think of the Magical Synchronization Diagram, which synchronizes with your own magic to create even greater magic.

There are several restrictions on the synchronization of that magic power, and above all, the caster must have at least magic power.

“I’m going to use Knowwet’s magic, not Snok’s magic.”

“You know?”

“It’s the return of the earth that this guy is holding.”

coup?

When his name came out, Knowwem wept suspiciously.

Snock realized what Elena was trying to do. But immediately another question arose.

“By the way, Lyla. If you use the magical powers of Wet... .”

Snock was speechless. But Lyla knew what he was trying to say.

The magical power of exorcism can be used by humans. Of course, if the intention to return is important and you are not a contractor, the efficiency will be extremely bad, but it can still be used.

But knowing how Knowwet's former contractor died was not easy to use.

"Okay. Even Lyla is not stupid.”

said Jack.

“You really only show the taste of magic. It's not even a direct contract situation, so the magical powers of Knowh won't continue to erode."

“Then what… .”

Snock took Knowwet in his hand. and made eye contact.

“Do it. How's your doctor?"

Although it was the words of a master like the sky, Snock was the doctor of Knowtm first. If I don't like Know Wet, then I never thought of doing it.

coup!

Fortunately, Knowh nodded. Nowt jumped out of Snock's hand. Then he climbed onto Elena's shoulder, who was glancing at her with curious eyes.

“Hey;”

She let out a small scream at the strange feeling of a small animal climbing up the hem of her robe.

But when he saw the bright eyes of Knowwet on his shoulder, he carefully put his finger on it.

clap!

Knowwet licked her finger and she smirked.

“Come on, let’s stop joking around with know-how for a while and go to class now.”

"Ah yes!"

Elena quickly straightened her posture.

“Now, you give Elena magic. He's a child who couldn't awaken his magic, so if he pours it in too hastily, it will hurt a lot. So little by little slowly. Understand?"

coo!

Nowet raised his front legs and shouted.

“And Elena.”

"Yes!"

“Even if the magic power of a ghost is something that a person can use, it is much more difficult to handle than her own. As long as they don't match well."

Lyla glanced at Snock.

"Besides, you've never used magic before, so that's even more so. So, focus as much as possible.”

"Yes!"

“The magic to use is the magic of the earth attribute. Do you know any magic?”

“Isn’t there a fire attribute?”

He also seems to want to use the magic of the school he belongs to. Lila shook her head.

“No web is the return of the earth. Of course, that magical power is full of the properties of the earth. It's difficult at your level to forcefully change that attribute. It's not suitable for this exercise, where I'm trying to get you to use your magic once."

" Yes."

Elena replied with regret.

“Think about it, Miss  Elena .”

Jack intervened.

“Isn’t it better to try the magic you really want with your own strength? Try the fire-attributed magic when the young lady uses her magical powers. Wouldn’t that be much more rewarding?”

“•••I heard it and saw it.”

Elena cheered up. Zich squinted one eye at Laila and fell back again.

“Then start.”

At Lyla's signal, Knowwem slowly began to inject magical energy into Elena's body.

Elena's eyes widened. I could feel the energy flowing through my body clearly.

'This is magic!'

For a moment, I felt joy in the sensation I felt for the first time in my life.

“Helena! Concentrate!”

Lyla's voice quickly caught her attention. And the magic of the body began to move.

What a long-awaited opportunity. How much did you want to feel? How much power I wanted to sleep.

'Never fail!'

Elena's concentration reached its maximum. According to her will, the magical energy of No Web inside her body began to move slowly.

“Well! Win! wood! Drew!”

started singing. It was several times more difficult than I thought to sing chanting while moving the magic power inside the body.

It felt like my tongue was constantly twisting. But she chanted slowly but surely.

The same goes for magic. It was difficult to move at first. But as she continued to arouse her will, the magical powers followed her will.

It didn't go as well as I imagined. Magical power moved more bluntly and slower than she had thought. However, she gradually realized the ideas that came to her mind.

Quad Duck!

Heaps of dirt around him rose and began to clump together in front of Elena's outstretched hand. It soon turned into a piece of dirt the size of a fist.

"one!" She finished her last chants.

pooong

A lump of dirt was shot

Pussack!

The lump of dirt smashed against a wooden pole. It's really sparse magic.

"Ah!"

But for Elena, it was more valuable magic than anything else.

She looks at Laila.

"•••Teacher."

“You did it.”

Lyla smiled kindly.

Tears welled up in Elena's eyes.

She ran to Lyla. Elena cried as she jumped into Laila's arms with her arms wide open.

She burst into tears as if trying to blow away all the sorrows she had received.

Zich, Snock, and Nowt watched the scene quietly.

Zich of the world quietly folded his arms as if he had no intention of ruining the atmosphere, and Snok rubbed his nose as if his emotions were contagious.

Knowing, who had already moved onto Snock's shoulder, looked at him with a calm gaze.

But as if there was something strange, Nowt kept tilting his head.

On the day Elena's first magic was successful, Elena used her magic power a few more times.

It was a really frivolous magic, but Elena was very happy with one spell at a time.

“Are you okay?”

"Yes!"

Because of this, I was able to answer Lyla's question with great strength.

“There is a difference between having the experience of moving magic and not having it. It will  certainly help to free the magical powers .”

"Yes!"

If so, how good would it be? One thing is certain, if you have magical powers, this experience will definitely be a good experience for you to release it.

“Then let’s get to it for today.”

"Yes? Can't we do a little more?”

I want to feel the sense of using magic a little more. But Lila shook her head resolutely.

“Look at your face and say.”

Elena patted her face. Although he had nothing to show his face, he was able to know his condition with just the sense of his hands. face full of sweat. The skin also seemed to have gotten a little rough.

“It’s only natural that I dealt with magic for the first time, and that was not my own. I'm not feeling it right now because it feels good, but the mental exhaustion is probably great."

'Come to think of it.'

Is it because of the sudden recognition? It felt like my head was spinning.

His whole body was drooping as if he had been drinking water. My eyelids were as heavy as a heavy stone on them, so I wanted to go to sleep right away.

“It certainly is. If I do more, I think I will fall.”

“Today is not the only day. I'll keep helping you for a while, so get a good rest today."

"Okay."

Although there was a deep regret, Elena nodded her head obediently. As if he had gotten used to it in a short period of time, he looked at Wet, who was lying with his stomach on his shoulder like a reserved seat.

“Did you say no?

coo.

“Thank you for today. May I ask you more often in the future?”

coup!

Noh nodded happily. She carefully places her hand in front of Knowwet. Nowet jumped off.

“Did you say Mr. Snock?”

" that's right."

Elena held out her hand to Snock.

“Thank you for lending me know.”

“It’s a job I chose. I didn't do anything. And I didn't borrow it. Know is not a thing.”

“Oh, sorry! I didn't mean that!”

Elena bowed her head in embarrassment.

“You have to be careful next time.”

“I will!”

As Snock held out his hand, the know that was in Elena's hand jumped up into Snock's hand. Elena glanced at Snock's eyes.

“Can you help me more often in the future?”

“Did you get permission from Knowtm earlier? Then I am not against it.”

"thank you."

Elena smiled brightly and greeted Snock.

Thus, the meaningful day when Elena used magic for the first time came to an end.

* * *

Zich and his party were in a carriage going back to their dorms. The carriage at Dwayne's mansion was given by Wilwess for Zich and the others.

As it was the exclusive carriage of the Matapju family, the ride was very good.

Zich and Snock were sitting next to each other, and Lyla was opposite them. Nowtm was lying on Snock's lap, rolling around.

“Know.”

coup?

Nowm shook his head. As Zich looked at him, he tilted his head.

“Today when I lent my magic to Elena. Did you feel anything strange?”

“Is that weird?”

Snock blinked. He knew that today's work had only come to help Elena with her magic studies. But after listening to Zich, it seemed that there was some other reason.

As he looked forward in doubt, Lyla was also looking at Knowwet with a serious face. Naturally, Snock also looked at Wett.

coo?

When people's eyes suddenly turned to look, No Wem panicked.

“No embarrassment. I have no intention of saying anything just because you didn't feel anything. Just tell me what you think.”

coup… .

Knowing closed his eyes at Zich's words and fell into thought. But there was no need to think long.

coup!

"Huh? Did something happen?”

Snock asked at Knowwet's reaction.

coup! coup!

As Knowwet nodded, of course Zich and Lyla were interested.

“What did you feel?”

coup! coup! Cuckoo! woohoo! coup!

Nowet jumped up on his hind legs, swinging his front legs and making a sound.

A know-how that goes around Snock's lap and expresses something. But there was no way Zich and Lyla could understand it.

Naturally, the two looked at Snok. It was asking for an interpreter.

“Oh, wait a minute.”

Snock listened intently to Knowwet's words (?). It's not that I don't understand Knowwet's words (?), but I'm still a contractor. The meaning was understandable enough.

"So that when people put earlier to shed a little horsepower, the same discomfort is  felt that?"

coup!

“I felt that some of my magic power was slightly lost, but I don’t know if it’s an illusion or real?”

coup!

“It says so.”

Zich and Lyla, who understood Snock's interpretation (?), began to exchange opinions.

“Some of the magic power is lost. After all, is there something strange being done to Elena's body?"

“It could be a mistake, seeing that we are not even sure. I'm sure it won, though."

“Is there a need to find out?”

"okay."

Zich said to Knowwet.

“I will accompany you and Snok to Elena’s magic study for a while. Then take a closer look at the strange thing you felt today.”

Then he took an apple from the magic box and handed it to Knowwet.

coo!

Now , hugging an apple the size of one third of his body, and crying happily, he crunched the apple.

Seeing Knowwet muttering an apple, Lila smiled slightly and licked Knowwet's nose. Shaking his head, Nowtm took another bite of the apple.

Kouuu ~ !

The wagon moved leisurely along the road with the joyful cry of a walnut.

* * *

Elena's training using Knowwet's magic continued. Even if it was borrowed magic, Elena, who had used magic, looked forward to Knowet's visit.

Although her body was tired after not using it a few times because she borrowed the magic of others, the charm of using magic herself was enough to make her forget her fatigue.

Taking the opportunity, Nowtm explored his own magical power that had entered Elena's body. And I could be sure.

“It is said that the magical energy that entered Mr. Dwayne’s body, although subtle, is definitely dissipated.”

At Snock's words, Zich and Lila nodded their heads.

“After all, there was something wrong with Elena’s body.”

“What are you going to do?”

At Lyla's question, Zich folded his arms.

“Honestly, just knowing that there is something wrong with Elena’s body doesn’t do much. Wasn't that one of the things you expected?"

“•••It is.”

Zich and Lyla knew that Elena Dwayne would become an outstanding wizard with overwhelming firepower in the future. That's why it's strange that she can't release her magic now.

“Besides, even if we knew that, there was no way for us to directly awaken Elena's magic power. But it is definitely an achievement that Knowwet found something directly, not just a prediction.”

coup?

Now, who was chewing the apple that Zich gave him today, he raised his head when he heard his name. But when Zich beckoned him to continue eating, he put his head down on the apple again.

“Then what  are you going to  do?”

“I have to tell you.”

Jack laughed.

“There’s something wrong with Helena’s body, and if she can do that, she might be able to use magic too.”

“To whom?”

“Of course, Elena’s family.”

Whoever heard it would have thought it was meant for Elena and her family. Indeed, Snock thought so.

But when she learns that Zich is suspicious of Elena's family members, Will Weiss and Orland, she thinks differently.

'I'm thinking of getting the suspects into action.'

If any of the two had done something to Elena, they were more likely to act when they found out that Zich and the others had found out about it.

“Dwayne’s parents are great people in the tower, aren’t they? That would increase the chances of solving Mr. Dwayne's problem.”

Snock was aware of Elena's situation because Knowwem had been with Elena when she lent her magic.

Snock was quite happy that the problem of a person who knew their face, even though they were close friends, was solved.

"of course. right."

Jack replied. He agreed to his statement, but Snock kept his mouth shut.

Snock, who had become very acquainted with Zee, noticed the meaning behind Zee's remarks.

'I don't know who it is, but it was taken by Zich.'

I don't know who the poor bastard was, but Snock slightly prayed for the author's life. If you see what Zich took, the villain must be obvious, so just a little bit.

coup… .

Perhaps No Web also realized Zich's meaningful words, so he crouched down behind the half-gnawed apple and hid.

Laila taught Elena every single day. However, no matter how much Leila enjoys teaching and Elena enjoys being taught, it cannot prevent fatigue from accumulating.

In particular, the blood of Elena, who was continuously instilled in magic, a complex science, reached a level that could not be recovered in just one day.

Therefore, Lyla decided to stop teaching Elena for a few days. Elena said she was fine, but she couldn't break Lyla's will.

She calmly decided to focus on her recovery at home. Lyla's insistence that she would no longer teach magic if she didn't rest quietly was an effective virtue.

And the next day. Lyla enjoyed her hobbies as she led Zich and arrived at Snoowick for the first time.

“It’s been a long time since I had this free time!”

Lyla said with her hands outstretched. Jack asked.

“Is the class difficult?”

“No, it was fun. Elena was also a cute and talented student.”

There is no lie in that thought. She obviously found it fun and rewarding to teach Elena.

“But I feel like I was too focused on class because it was fun. I didn't do what I was supposed to do.”

Even before coming to Snoowick, I was excited about collecting information about various magic.

In addition, he had to search for information about the ancient empire, Cloone, and decipher the books that were supposed to belong to Cloone, which he had brought from the Great Forest of Adrowon.

But now that I think about it, I haven't been able to achieve any of them.

“It is not. Teaching Elena was also a plan, so I didn't say much, but it sure seemed like you were too engrossed in that."

"You're right. I'll have to take a day off from now on. That will improve the effectiveness of education.”

“That’s what I agree with. But for now, I'll have to deal with something else first."

Zich's eyes slowly moved to the side.

“Did you notice?”

“You can’t even notice that you’re moving so openly.”

Lyla tapped the ground with the wand she was holding.

“It seems that the humans I wanted have finally visited.”

"I'm glad. That's why you deliberately wandered around in such a rare place, didn't you?"

“It always feels good when a plan pays off.”

Zich pulled Windur off his back. And looked around and said.

“I’ve already been caught, so come out quietly. Let me see your face.”

Shadows gathered around Zich and Lyla.

(Continued on next page)

The deserted place where Zich walked to lure the raiders was a quiet forest outside Snoowick.

The forest generated on the plains near the city was quite large. It was also a place so thick with trees and bushes that city children often get lost while playing.

Naturally, humans were rare.

It is a very good environment for Zich. It means that even if you beat up the assailants nicely, there are no people who will be quacked.

'They seem to have similar thoughts.'

The assailants were wearing their robes pressed down one by one. A look that lacks even a single personality.

'Are they robes?'

I thought there was a lot of possibility.

'This time, I wish I was a little bubbly.'

Torture doesn't work for them, so we have to keep talking to them and thinking about them.

Because of that, I hoped that the conversation would continue. The more words, the better.

But when Zich saw the people around him, he tilted his head.

'The robes... is not it?'

The robe gnomes are thoroughly restrained in their movements. Even if you pretend to be, you can feel the feeling of receiving special training as a group from the movement.

However, the group that appeared in front of Zich didn't feel like the robes he had ever seen.

Even some of them could not find any traces of training in their movements.

But they wouldn't have brought ordinary people to such a raid.

'You're a wizard.'

They can understand that there are no signs of training in their movements.

However, with the exception of some who were presumed to be wizards, all of them showed signs of training. However, their movements were very rough.

'Are you a mercenary?'

At least, it was not the appearance of accumulating systematic training.

'A mercenary to a wizard. The first thing that comes to mind is the picture that wizards hired mercenaries to attack.'

Zich spoke at once.

“What are you? I don't know where they live, but it doesn't seem like they went for a walk to such a remote place. Once I saw that they interfered with a private date, it seems certain that they are ignorant people.”

“What is a date?”

Lyla snorted.

Those who wore robes did not respond. It was only slowly tightening the encirclement.

visor! visor!

Those who approached take out swords from their arms. Those in robes who were staying behind pulled out their staffs and raised them.

“Let me ask you, do you know who we are and fight? He's quite a celebrity in Snoowick."

The fact that the teacher who taught the fallen genius Elena Dwayne easily defeated Ma Win Jawick, the master of the tower, was already famous within the tower and spread widely in Snoowick.

Laughter was heard from behind the robes.

A twisted, mocking laughter. Zich looked at him.

“You seem to know us, too. Seeing you smile like that If possible, would you mind taking off that filthy rag? Oh, if your face is like an orc that a human can't see at all, I'll understand, so you can use more. No, if so, please write. My heart is so delicate that seeing such a nightmare of a human will hurt me.”

The laughter that had been heard was cut off.

Minutes later, a car wheezing sound was heard. The laughter of others hid his cold voice.

“The cooperation is also a mess. Even if the opponent is an orc who has the appearance of closing his eyes and running away, if he is a companion, he has to show an act of enveloping him. Are you laughing at it again? Seeing that he was wearing the same robes, he must have had a well-formed face and not eaten.”

The new laughter stopped. The forest was covered with an eerie silence and unpleasant life.

“•••As I heard, the snout is rough.” The one who wore the robe who was closest to Zich said. It wasn't a good voice to hear because it was thick and rough. It seemed that his voice alone would press on people's minds.

However, Zich was unconcerned.

“I’m sorry for this. As you can see, me and my close friends are the so-called handsome men. I didn't understand your unpleasant and miserable appearance, so I said that. My apologies.”

Zich bowed his back exaggeratedly.

"do not worry. Humans with terrible looks like you will surely find their love. Unfortunately, it would be impossible among the same human beings. Oh, and maybe even orcs and trolls would reject them? It's ok though. If it were the monsters below that, maybe, really, maybe! He might be able to understand you.”

As if he were a god of charity, Ziq spread out his arms.

“There are many different forms of love in the world. So I understand your love. Cancer, don’t understand!”

Zich trembled with emotion. said to Lila.

“How could I ever say such a loving thing! Maybe I'm not a good scum, but a really good person? After all, Carwiman sees people well… !”

“Stop talking nonsense.”

Leila cut off Zich's useless words, which should have been good, adamantly. Zich pouted his lips, but he didn't keep talking nonsense.

“••• It has been decided.”

The man who sarcastic Zich had a rough snout spoke again.

“I’m going to put some stripes on your handsome face. No, I'm going to peel my face off completely. But let's see where you can say the same thing."

He growled as he moved his sharp sword alive.

“Do it if you can. I was also thinking that I should leave a cut on this neat face and attach the dignity.”

Zich put his finger on his cheek and stroked it softly.

“But I wonder if it will be possible with your skills.”

“Are you campaigning like that just by defeating Jack Ma?”

"no. He's a genius at the tower, but to us he wasn't the kind of guy we cared much about. He's obviously half the reason why we're famous at Horseshoe and Snoowick, but he's too weak to campaign for defeating one of them. Isn't it, Lyla?"

“… geek.”

"Huh?"

“Who is Marwin Jawick?”

Here, Zich also kept his mouth shut for a moment. I thought it was a joke, but looking at Laila's expression, it wasn't a joke at all.

“Did you just forgot? There's a guy that you and I had a duel in the tower."

"Ahhh. him?”

At that moment, Laila clapped her hands as if she had remembered.

“Is his name Marwin Jawick?”

“••• Hey, I think this is a bit harsh too. Still, it's an opponent I had a duel with a while ago, shouldn't I have some memory?"

“Still, it’s unavoidable. Because he wasn't that impressive.

I had no skills.”

“If he had been here, he would probably go north to north.”

It was the time when Zich said that and was absurd.

pudding!

I heard this grinding sound.

Even if the resentment hits the bone marrow and grinds all the teeth, the sound is enough to feel that it can be tolerated. Zich's eyes turned towards him.

His gaze was directed to a man behind the robes.

“What kind of guy grinds his teeth like that… .”

Zich tilted his head. eyes widened

“… Are you Marwin Jaewick?”

There was no answer. However, depending on the situation, silence becomes a strong affirmation above all else.

“That’s right, you bastard!”

Zich clapped his hands together.

“Are you the one who led this attack? Didn't you think you had something in your heart that was beaten by Lyla? Being a genius at the Magic Tower has a heart the size of an ant’s nostrils!”

“I, I am not Marwin Jawick!”

he hurriedly shouted

But that was no longer the case. Zich was pointing a finger at him, and his co-workers shook their heads.

“By the way, was it you who laughed at me earlier when I said I was a celebrity? Could it be that you couldn't accept the victory or defeat at that time?"

"of course!"

As if he had just decided to leave what had already been caught, Mawin Jawick exclaimed loudly.

“Do you think I’ll accept that I won a cowardly victory by cheating!”

"Trickery?"

Zich was absurd.

It's not because they're calling them unscrupulous cheaters. Zich is a human being who can cheat as long as he can get what he wants.

Now he had another reason to be absurd.

“Why against you?”

Even a chariot like Marwin Jawick couldn't put a finger on Zich or Laila, even if a cart came. But why do they cheat?

“I just thought he was a well-bred, good-looking master of a house, but delusion is a disease. I live well at home, so I would recommend getting a good doctor or referral and recuperating with all your strength.”

“Everything I heard from reliable sources, you scumbag!”

Mawin Jawick exclaimed. Hearing those words, Zich's eyes widened in an instant.

"okay? Did someone give you such information?”

The atmosphere has changed. Jack Ma took a step back and his men tensed.

“Let’s check one out first, Ma Win Jake. Now this is retaliation against us for cheating, right?”

"okay! Are you going to admit it now?”

Although Zich is still grumpy, he seems to admit to cheating, so Jack Ma affirmed.

“Someone told us we were cheating/

"Yes!"

“The raiders are probably wizards from your school and hired mercenaries, right?”

“I’m a wanderer, so I have a bit of a sense of humor! But it's already too late! Gatjaneun using a trick to humiliate a successor, or the Blue bloods of the re-Week matap who  sin! Pay me here!”

Jack sighed.

“You idiot. If you thought it was a trick, you might have to try again.”

“Yeah, what did you mean by teaching them fractions!”

'Oh, I hated that.' Zich could understand Jack Ma's heart.

'Even if it was a trick, it would have been difficult to challenge Laila again, who unilaterally defeated him.'

Coward. Zich added one more negative word to Jack Ma's evaluation.

Zich scratched the back of his head.

'It's not the picture you want.'

I wanted Rob guys, Willwes Dwayne, and guys related to Orland Dwayne, but when I caught them, I found an odd fish. But it was too early to be disappointed.

'Still, it seems that there is a guy who encouraged that guy, so let's put our hopes on that.'

“Are you done thinking?”

When Lila asked, Zich nodded.

“You held up well. You can blow it away now.”

“That’s fine.”

Lyla raised her wand. Her cold eyes swept the crowd.

“I didn’t like their eyes.”

The sticky, self-scrutinizing eyes still bothered him.

“What about power control?”

Lyla asked while preparing the magic.

In order to extract information through torture, the opponent must be alive, so it is better to weaken the power. But Zich didn't want to meddle in what his friend wanted to do.

“Do what you like. I'll take care of anyone who needs it."

“You know what, Zich?”

Woo woo woo woo!

Magical power surged from Lyla's staff.

“Yeah, I really like that.”

woo woo woo!

The magic has been activated.

# No. 243 screen

Marwin Jawick could never forget that day.

As the heir of a prestigious family and a brilliant man in the tower, he has only been running on a perfect and solid road.

Even when his peers slipped, one by one, blocked by the harshness of magic, his sprint did not stop.

His ability to distance himself from his peers has already succeeded in catching up with those who were walking the path of magic first.

Confidence grew naturally.

It would have been fine if it had stopped there.

His character went beyond self-confidence to arrogance.

Usually, that arrogance catches the ankle. However, Jack Ma's outstanding talent and his family gave him the strength to ignore even the criticism of people.

Obviously there are a lot of people who hate him and look down on him. However, there were a lot of people who flattered him.

An environment has been created in which people who hate themselves can think that they are all jealous nerds.

For this reason, Jack Ma has maintained an arrogant disposition.

until some time ago.

The sound of a magician teaching Elena Dwayne circulated through the tower. And that turned out to be true.

As soon as he knew this, Jack Ma couldn't control the sneer that came out of him.

Elena Dwayne.

A genius who was considered to have greater talent than himself in a family greater than himself.

However, it was revealed that there is no magic power that can be said to be more precious than life, and now the great magician has banned him from even studying magic.

For Ma, who was jealous of her as a child, her downfall was a very pleasant event.

Occasionally, I saw her once in a while.

Of course, I didn't pretend to know. Because she and she live in a different world.

I just saw it from afar.

She looked like a loser.

But I only enjoy it once or twice. Elena's presence in his mind slowly faded.

It was then that I heard about Elena's teacher.

Matthew's granddaughter takes a wanderer as a teacher. At first, it was only a laugh, but the more I thought about it, the more I got annoyed.

Are you still thinking in vain that you want to become a wizard because you have no magical powers? So I quarreled. Elena De Wayne, of course, was going to shout at the wandering wizard who dared to claim to be a teacher at a young age, who didn't understand the subject.

But his confidence was completely shattered that day.

Two people who dared to challenge themselves.

A wandering wizard who doesn't understand the subject of teaching Elena, and the wizard's close friend, a slasher who doesn't even know how to use a haircut that insulted him.

It was meant to teach the nobleness and difficulty of the science of magic thoroughly.

But it was he who lost the duel. After all, after being thoroughly teased.

He didn't lose his life, but he didn't even know he lost perhaps more than his life in the duel.

The magic that he had boasted in the tower until now was thoroughly blown out by Laila's magic. He did not want to admit defeat, so he clenched his fists and rushed, but he was beaten.

Moreover, even his life was saved by an ignorant knife-slayer.

From then on, contempt and ridicule poured upon him.

There weren't many people who laughed openly, but Ma Win couldn't be unaware of the gaze that was being sent to him.

Because it was the gaze he always had on the losers below him.

In addition, some have directly quarreled. They were people similar to him in family and talent.

could not forgive

How dare you insult yourself, who will continue to walk the path of magic and become the master of magic in the future. Even in places with so many people.

Using a dark grudge as a raw material, he sharpened his sword of revenge.

But revenge was not easy.

The best way was to apply for a duel again, but it didn't seem like he could ever beat Lyla.

But heaven did not forsake him.

Someone gave him information while he was grumbling with a desperate grudge.

The duel at that time was said to have been cheated by the opponent.

Marwin thought.

'Well then!'

If there is no such thing as cheating, how can you get tired of a woman who looks your age?

Rather, I wondered why the trick had not been conceived in the first place.

Knowing that he had cheated, of course he had to take revenge. I was going to send a duel right away.

But even though I was thinking hard with my head, my body did not move. The fists flying towards him and the magic that Lyla had seen last came to mind over and over again.

I didn't have the courage. But he did not consider himself a coward.

'Since I've been deceived, it's natural to worry that there won't be another trick.'

He did so as an excuse for an immobile body.

I stopped taking revenge through duels. However, he did not give up on revenge.

After much deliberation, he came to an idea.

It was a very simple method.

'Let's attack.'

Those who dare to deceive in the sacred duel. Is there any need to use a fair method?

'No matter how closely I teach Elena Dwayne, it won't stick to me for a hundred days. You just have to aim for gaps on the days they're off.'

He slowly began to prepare.

In a duel, the person who informed that the opponent was cheating was asked to gather people. Among the people of the school following his father, he recruited a few who would do his favor.

Once they were ready, all that was left was to set a point for the raid.

As for what else to teach the scammer topic, the scammer stuck with Elena Dwayne and didn't get a good chance.

But his persistence eventually triumphed. The scammers have finally stopped training.

That was not enough, so I left the city and entered the nearby forest.

It was only the two people who insulted them that they moved.

It was literally a heaven-given opportunity. If you miss this opportunity, you never know when this perfect opportunity will come again.

He hastily moved the troops he had prepared. And he succeeded in besieging them both.

'Win!'

He was sure of victory. Now all that's left is how to cook them.

It's good to kill them cleanly, beat them until they're out of anger, or keep them alive and give them shame and humiliation. He fell into a pleasant dream.

Of course, there were unexpected situations in which his identity was revealed in the middle.

The chafi robe was just what he was wearing just in case, so it didn't matter.

It would be enough to kneel down on someone who continues to insult you without notice.

But why? The reason why a woman who is obviously a con artist, who should be clear, radiates such overwhelming magical power.

“Kill those guys!”

Marwin shouted hastily. The hired mercenaries rushed in and the wizards who brought them memorized spells.

They also realized that Lyla's momentum was unusual, so there was no playfulness at all. Rather, it seemed desperate.

However, Lyla's magic had already been completed.

It wasn't even a short chant or a shortened chant, but it was incredibly fast.

“Willa! Phil!”

Drops of water began to form over Lila's head. They come together to form a huge pool of water. The swirling blobs of water spewed out water droplets in all directions.

at an incredibly fast pace.

puck! puck! puck! puck!

“Hey heck!”

“Great!”

“Aww!”

It was only water droplets the size of a fingernail, but they pierced the human body like a sword pierced through soft mud.

Screams erupted from everywhere. But there were those who couldn't even do that.

Whoops! Whoops!

Just like a watermelon shatters, the heads of people hit with water drops explode. They couldn't even get a hangover.

The mercenaries tried to protect themselves somehow.

Some people blocked the attack by intercepting water droplets, while others hid behind trees. Rather, there were those who attacked Lyla by throwing knives.

But to no avail.

puff puff puff!

“Cool!”

The mercenary who chose to intercept had a hole in his body that was pushed by the number of constantly flying water drops.

perok

“Shut up!”

The person hiding behind the tree was pierced by a drop of water that pierced the whole tree.

Puppupuck!

“Big!”

The one who threw the sword became a beehive like everyone else.

But he kept his eyes wide open until the end. He was determined to see the knife he threw into Laila's body.

However, his desperate determination was only shattered with the lift of a finger by Laila.

visor!

The blade of the wind made of a mixture of no chorus and double chant intercepted the blade that was flying at Lyla with so much ease.

«... Zen...!”

He couldn't even utter a swear word until the end, and he stopped breathing.

Drops of water falling from the sky had a long range.

He was able to put all the raiders surrounding Zich and Lyla within range. Naturally, the attack also reached the wizards in the rear.

“Great!”

“Oh, billion!”

They thought that there would be no direct battle in the rear, and they had no way to stop the magic.

There was no outstanding physical ability, and he could not use magic without singing like Lyla.

Their bodies were transformed into rags in the blink of an eye.

But it didn't mean that no one survived.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

Zich suddenly appeared in front of a mercenary who was intercepting the water droplets to somehow survive.

The mercenary opened his eyes in surprise, but Zich did not know his situation.

“You seem to know something.”

Whoops!

Zich's hand smacked the mercenary's head. Unable to even scream, he rolled his eyes and fainted. Zich, who was carrying his falling body, moved.

“I think you will be useful too.”

Whoops!

Hit the other mercenaries and put them on top of the mercenary you took up first.

In the meantime, water drops continued to pour.

“Okay!”

Zich waved his hand. Magic power rushed around him.

Whoops!

The drops of water that were slaughtering mercenaries and magicians mercilessly burst out too easily.

Now they have become ordinary water, pouring down. After a moment of safety, Zich went to Lyla.

Lyla's magic, which had made the inside of the intersection into hell, was also not scattering drops of water where she was.

Zich roughly threw the mercenaries at Lyla's feet.

and moved again. This time, he has rescued a few wizards from a distance.

As before, he throws it at Lyla's feet and moves again.

How many times did you go back and forth like that?

'Is this enough?'

Jack nodded his head. And he moved towards the last one to bring.

"female!"

Zich appeared in front of Ma Win, whose face was distorted in fear and despair. Completely different from Ma Win, he looked like he had nothing to do with being carefree.

"Good night."

perok

This time, the same one in the back of the head. Marwin rolled his eyes. Zich picked him up and carried him back to Lyla's side.

Zich's movement ended with that. After even Ma had set down on the ground, he crossed his arms and looked at the battlefield.

Most of the humans have died and the rest seem to be few.

Zich looked up this time.

The size of the water ball was significantly reduced. But for the next few minutes, you will spit out plenty of water.

“It will be over soon.”

He yawned freely and folded his arms.

As Zich said, after a while, the water ball in the air disappeared and the magic was over.

All that was left was blood, mixed with the terrible chunks of meat and water, seeping into the surrounding ground. And it was the appearance of a completely devastated forest.

"after!"

Lyla lowered her wand's hand. Freshness mixed with the exhaled breath.

“Are you feeling better?'

“Roughly.”

Lyla stopped to take a step. There was a mercenary that Zich had stunned where he was about to step.

Whoops!

The mercenary rolled a few laps as she kicked it. He groaned in pain, but did not wake up.

“Have you saved quite a lot?”

“Because you don't know who has the important information. First of all, I only picked those with more skills.”

“Would it have been better to be a little more patient?”

Lila shuddered if Zich had suffered a loss because of her feelings.

“This is enough. As mercenaries and wizards were properly mixed and saved, there would be quite a bit of information. Besides, I saved the most important one.”

Zich pulled a man out of the pile of stunned humans. It was Marwin's reign.

“Looking at your face, I remember a little bit now. right. This was the one I had dueled with.”

“… Did you really not know?”

“Aren’t you the kind of person who needs to remember?”

“Me too, but you are great too.”

Laila shuddered at Zich's tone of voice. No matter how much he didn't remember the person he was fighting with, if the party heard that he did a job that would be absolutely heartbreaking, would that be enough for Zich to say something like that?

“Why did you remember such a good guy like that? You tend to forget the little things.”

“It’s because he wasn’t someone who easily forgets his grudge just by looking at it. He's going to hit the back of the head anytime, anywhere, so for the time being, he should stay well in his memory."

When Zich made sense, Lila pursed her lips. However, at Zich's words that followed, he nodded, saying, 'That's right'.

“And remember that well, you can scratch your temper a bit later when you fuck him. There are some people who get more excited by scratching with small details.”

“•••No matter how dirty I am, I don’t think it’s good for you.”

"of course. You have to roll in mud for at least a few decades to keep up with my temper.”

“Please don’t be proud of that.”

Even in a forest full of dead bodies, the two of them continued to talk.

Zich brought a large fallen tree. When laid down, it became a great wall. Zich placed the stunned ones side by side, leaning against the wall.

Lyla sat on a tree with only the stump left by her magic from a distance and watched it.

“Are you going to dig up information?”

“It should be. Is that why you saved me?”

“How are you going to dig it out?”

“There’s only one way to get information from those who can trample on them, right?”

Lyla could well guess what the method was.

“I didn’t write these robes because torture doesn’t work, but I’m also good at what I do on the floor.”

Zich looked at Laila and said.

“If you have a weak heart, I would recommend not watching.”

Marwin Jawick came to his senses. He frowned at the tingling in the back of his head that still remained.

I felt bad. But that feeling was blown away in an instant by a sudden scream.

"town! town!"

I tried to scream, but there was something in my mouth. It didn't sound right.

“Ugh!”

I tried my body He didn't even move. The whole body was tightly bound. I couldn't even see an eye. There was something on his face.

“Are you awake?”

a voice is heard It was a sound I had ever heard. A human being who had seen him in the past and spit out all kinds of insults. No, I've never been there before. Didn't he mock himself with that voice even when he attacked?

'attack?'

In an instant I remembered everything. Most of the people she mobilized died in the overwhelming magic that she thought was a fraudster. And then something happened to the unlucky guy who suddenly appeared.

'And I lost consciousness.'

captivated I could only think of it that way.

“Are you about to finish judging the situation?”

said Jack. Ma Win jumped to break the chains. However, the bond that Zich had made was too tight for the wizard to break.

“It’s no use anyway… Even if I say, I won't give up. Well, let's do what you like for a while. After all, it’s still your turn.”

'order? What does that mean?'

Ma Win's question was soon resolved. In a very terrifying and terrifying way for him.

“Aaaaaaaaaah!” A voice was heard from a little far away. Although his eyes could not be seen, at least he could guess from the sound he could hear. That the owner of the voice was never being treated mildly.

“Let’s go easy on each other. Will you quit if I tell you what I want?”

“Everyone, you said it all! I said everything I knew!”

Perhaps it was the voice of the mercenary he hired.

“How many times have I told you? What I want is the answer I want, not what you know. But what you said was information that the other guy had already blown away. I need other information.”

“Yeah, so you said it! Other than that, I don't know!”

“It’s so sad. If you are, then I have no choice but to do this more with tears in my eyes. Oh, sorry. The only person in this world who understands my heart is the flower that blooms on that mountain.”

“If you want to say something like that, change your expression, you demonic bastard!”

"Hahaha! After all, I have no intention of losing to the devil either. I just felt a little offended by those words. It looks like you don't know any more anyway, so let's start with that useless mouth, shall we?"

“Come on, wait… ! stop!"

But his pleas crumbled like the dew disappearing into the mist. A terrifying scream followed shortly thereafter.

Marwin's teeth began to clashed. Come to think of it, there was a strange tickling smell in my nose. I didn't know what it was, but when the situation was cleared up, I had one guess.

'Blood!'

In a place where sight cannot be used and the sense of hearing and smell cannot be seen, it is telling that a terrible situation is going on.

His clothes were wet with cold sweat. All sorts of terrible thoughts ran through my mind.

drop!

The scream stopped. At the same time, there was the sound of something collapsing on the floor. footstep sounds Ma Winn gasped for breath at the sight of getting a little closer to him.

“Now then, shall I ask you?”

It started screaming again. It's a different voice this time. Ma Win's trembling grew even bigger.

“You are the last.”

The sign stopped in front of him. Marwin swallowed his saliva. But there was no moisture in the dry mouth.

“Did you hear the questions I asked so far?”

of course I heard I didn't want to hear it, but my hands were tied behind my back and it was impossible to cover my ears. In the end, he had no choice but to listen to both the questions he asked and the answers given by the victims. With a terrible scream.

“You’re going to have to say things that others haven’t.”

A cold, sharp touch touched his thigh. There was a burning pain. It looked like it had been cut a little. Because his eyes were not visible, his sensitive touch conveyed the feeling of blood flowing from the wound as it was.

Marwin nodded his head relentlessly. I didn't mean to keep my mouth shut like a knight in a story caught in an enemy camp anyway.

To that end, I was afraid of the screams I had heard so far and the bloody smell that kept coming into my nostrils.

Rather, I wish I had asked the question sooner. I wanted to spit out everything and feel comfortable.

But what came back was not a question.

“Before that, let’s make some preparations. Because you can't cheat on anything."

The sharp feel of the knife touching his thigh grew a little stronger.

"town! Oops!”

Marwin cried out. I just wanted to say that I would never lie. Zich knew his intentions. However, there was nothing to reduce the power given to Windur.

"I know, I know. do you want to say anything? Do you think you can teach me all the information I want? But unfortunately, I don’t trust people very well.”

"town! town! Oops!”

“Just a moment. It'll be over soon, so be patient. Understand?"

A gentle voice that doesn't fit the situation at all. However, the results did not match the tone.

Push!

“Turn it off!”

At the boiling pain, Ma let out a miserable moan.

* * *

Zich took a bucket of water from the magic box. I put my hand into the jug of clear water. The blood staining his hands slowly faded in the clear water.

"it's over?"

When the screams ceased, in the forest

Ila walked out. She was able to use her cruel hands if necessary, but she was not inclined to enjoy other people's blood or pain, so she hid herself for a while.

“The information to be extracted was roughly extracted.”

“What information was it?”

“Don’t expect it. Because it wasn't that great of information.”

Zich looked at the informants who had now become horrendous corpses.

“The mercenaries and wizards were just hired. The mercenaries were hired for the money, and the wizards were the ones who bet and cooperated with Ma Winn Zawick later becoming the head of the Order.”

Zich raised his little finger.

“In other words, they are scoundrels.”

“Then what about Jack Marvin?”

Lyla's gaze turned to the only living person.

It didn't look like he was in a bad mood with all his robes stained with blood, but he looked fine. It was probably treated with potions.

“It looks like he has come up with this plan.”

“Then it was just a grudge attack, right?”

For those who were waiting for the attack of the being who was supposed to have blocked Elena's growth, it was a bit of a letdown.

“On the surface, yes. But when I asked a little more detail, he came up with a pretty interesting story.”

“What are you talking about?”

“There is someone who can help you.”

As long as Ma is a master of a prestigious family, the person who helps him will be strong and fierce.

But Zich wouldn't talk about such a natural existence as important. Lila had an idea that came to mind.

“By the way, did that guy have any luck with 'information he heard from a reliable source'? Is it that guy?”

"right."

“What kind of being are you?”

“I don’t know.”

"•••what?"

“You don’t even know.”

Zich shrugged his shoulders very casually.

“•••Aren't you lying?”

“It is absolutely not. I've built a very strong relationship of trust so he can't lie to my kind questions."

Lyla didn't ask how.

“Then you were really helped by an unknown entity?”

“He even trusted me a lot.”

Jack laughed. But it wasn't a good laugh. Anyone who could see it was laughing at Ma Win's stupidity.

“Oh, come to think of it, you said that guy cheated on you, right? They believe that you cowardly entered a duel with a rare artifact you found in an ancient ruin.”

“•••No, the only thing that is recognized in the duel between wizards is the staff, but did you believe it? How many magics did I use back then? I can't even create an artifact that can use them all!"

“So you said it. A precious artifact found in an ancient ruin.”

“•••I have a favor, Zich”

"do not worry. I have no intention of smashing the image of a wizard to the ground because of that idiot over there.”

"Thank you so much."

Did Lila ever thank her so much? It seems that he didn't want to be treated like that idiot.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 245 screen

“But I don’t want to get too excited. You have to think about that guy’s position as well.”

“What are you going to do, considering the position of such an idiot?”

Apparently, Lyla wanted to be very strict with Ma Win.

“It’s not that I don’t understand your point of view. Still, he's the guy who heard the sound of water from the tower. Are we really as stupid as we think?”

“You look stupid enough. And you know Zich, right? That the head of studying science and the head of living in the world are different.”

"know. don't know enough But even with that in mind, Jack Ma’s beliefs are strange enough.”

“Then what, did you mean you were brainwashed?”

“If it’s brainwashing, it’s brainwashing. What do you think is the best way to get people to believe in you? That’s performance.” As if telling a great truth, Zich said so.

“Think about it. We believe in the future knowledge we know because it can be applied to reality, that is, because we have a track record. If it weren't for that, we'd just be the ones to suspect mental illness."

“Are you saying that the mysterious existence showed Mawin Jawick performance? Enough to make you believe such a stupid thing?”

“If you listen to the story, it is said that he gave advice on things like studying his own magic in a small way, and in a big way, such as a position within a family or a tower. At first, of course, I was skeptical, but if it all comes true, that’s a different story.” “Then, did that assistant use his hand again this time?”

“It’s not like a facilitator. If you listen to that guy, he cleverly took advantage of his revenge. You want us to get revenge.”

“In a word, is that guy a black screen?”

“It is very likely.”

“Can you catch me?”

Jack shook his head.

“He ’s the  guy who  completely hid himself and helped out. From what I've heard, even his family doesn't know about the existence of darkness. If you find out that Jaewick has been caught, there's a good chance you'll turn away. He seems to think that the black screen will save him.”

“Then it was in vain.”

“It is not. Because the guy most likely the guy we're looking for has targeted us. In other words, what we do is not wrong.”

Zich said confidently.

“Besides, I wonder if he really intended to kill us.”

“You weren’t targeting us?”

Lila rolled her eyes.

"lets think. If that black man wasn't really the kind of fairy who gave Mojiri a gift, he would have provoked him for some reason. What will happen if he succeeds and we die?”

“Helena will lose her teacher.”

And other than that, nothing great. because they are wanderers Although Elena will ask for an investigation, it is unlikely that Snoowick or Matota will take it seriously.

“But is that really what caused this to happen? What if I was just throwing away the guy I trusted with the whole thing? No matter how stupid that guy is, he's a kid who can be used here and there as a son of a noble family. Anyone who can roast a son of a noble family in the tower would not dare to resort to such a dangerous method to separate us from Elena.”

“Then what do you think their purpose is?”

“Clash of Dwayne and Jawick.”

Jack said with a smirk.

“No matter how much we wander, we are Elena Dwayne’s teacher. Of course, if we disappear without a trace, there won't be much of a fuss, but it will change if there are direct rumors. Marwin Jawick of the Jawyck family attacked Elena Dwayne's teacher with a personal grudge. That Marwin Jawick is also the one who usually ignores Elena Dwayne.”

“It’s not going to get better between you two.”

“At least it wouldn’t be good now, would it? Because we, to be precise, you publicly smashed Jack Ma.”

Lyla snorted.

“And conflict, if there is a cause, burns in an instant.”

“Then what will you do?”

“What can I do?”

Zich looked at Marwin.

“Now that you’re making the stage in earnest, you should have fun riding it.”

Like an actor in a famous play who finally got to the stage he wanted, Zich smiled brightly.

♦ * *

The tower was overturned. Ma-Win Jawick, the son of the Jawick family, who was a member of the Matop family, was attacked with a private grudge against the teacher who taught Elena Dwayne, the granddaughter of Ma-Tap Master.

In the original case, the city's security forces would have to deal with it. The problem, however, is that in this case, the two famous families of Matop were connected.

Wilwes Dwayne, the lord of Matthew, and Orland Dwayne, who was able to attend the supreme meeting of the matob, and Dwayne with these two were certainly higher in authority and power than the Jaewick, but it was not a family that the Zawick family was missing.

In addition, in this case, the heir of the Zawick family, Marwin Zawick, was almost wiped out, and some of the mages of the Quaral School, a school headed by the Zawick family, also died.

Naturally, the Jaewick family protested fiercely. He raised his voice saying that a detailed investigation should be carried out.

He did not even admit to the fact that Jack Ma had attacked in the first place.

The supreme meeting of the tower was held.

Ten wizards gathered in the conference room. Everyone had a serious expression on their face. Among them, there were three people with particularly strong expressions.

The parties involved in this case were Wilwes Dwayne, Orland Dwayne, and Wayne Jake.

The meeting went on seriously. At first glance, Goseong came and went. In particular, the fight between Orland and Wayne was huge. They put blood on each other's necks and made a very loud noise.

" first...."

Wilwes said in a tired voice.

“I think an investigation is necessary. Let me hold those two for a while.”

“It's not enough! Arm yourself and get rid of it! They must be put in prison one by one and thoroughly interrogated!”

"gibberish!"

Orland objected to Wayne's words.

“You conceded a hundred times, admitting the need for an investigation, but treating them like criminals! Anyone can see that this is not your son's fault!"

"what!"

Wayne's face turned red.

“Aren’t you going to cover up even a defective bastard with no magical powers as a bastard! What a big dress you put on a bitch like that!”

“Even if he doesn’t have magical powers, he’s not so stupid that he takes a bunch of mercenaries and sorcerers from a duel with a grudge and kills them all, and even dies right before he dies! You must be very proud to have a wonderful son!”

"what!"

"quiet!"

Eventually, Willwes shouted loudly. Orland and Wayne kept their mouths shut as they were bold.

But they didn't stop looking at each other. If someone held only a sword in their hand, they would stab each other in excitement.

“I will proceed with the investigation into this case.”

As Wilwes spoke, all eyes turned to him. No one had an opinion on this.

“Allow them to be imprisoned. But not a prison. Rent an ordinary house, lock it in, and keep an eye on it.”

“Matap Master!”

Wayne shouted loudly. But Will Weiss ignored it and continued.

“I will disarm the two of you and prevent them from meeting in the house. Isn't this enough?"

“It's the other way around! pass it! They did nothing wrong!”

This time Orland exclaimed.

However, the atmosphere of the meeting was already convincing with Wilwes' orders. Among the people who had gathered here in the first place, there were very few people who had a favor with Zich and Lyla.

Apparently, he had no choice but to be more interested in the same wizard, Ma Win and his companions. In addition, the torture Zich used to obtain information was also a problem.

Orland read the atmosphere and sharpened his teeth. He looked at Wilwes.

“Are you really going to be like this, Dad?”

“Don't use personal names, Dwayne. This is the total will of those who attended the meeting. No matter how disliked you are, you have a duty to obey.”

“… I don't think you're going to get rid of Elena's teacher right now and give up on Elena's magic study."

“•••Speak hard, Dwayne!”

Wilwes yelled, but Orland continued to stare at him.

“••• Because of the consensus gathered at the meeting, I was compelled to do my duty as a mato. I hope that your father’s claim is true.”

And Orland left the conference room with a cool breeze.

Thus, the supreme meeting of the Matops on this situation ended.

Zich and Lyla were at Dwayne's mansion. Snock, who had taken Elena with him to teach, and Hans, who had usually left him alone, were with him.

After the incident happened, Wilwes Dwayne called them into the mansion for both monitoring and protection. Zich did not refuse, and he took his party and quietly came to Dwayne's mansion.

“It will be fine!”

Elena, who was standing nearby, constantly restless, said aloud.

“Teacher and Mr. Zich have never done anything wrong! My father also said that he gave me strength, so it shouldn’t be a big deal!”

'Then it's difficult.'

Contrary to Elena's hopes, Zich wanted something to happen. Also, the bigger the better. But I didn't get tea. He smiled at Elena.

“I look forward to it.”

And then I went back to what I was doing. It was nothing. In boredom, I just keep ticking my feet.

Elena looked at Zich and the others. The parties involved in the case, Zich and Lila, as well as Hans and Snock, who were in the two parties, were too casual. Seeing this, it seemed like he was in a hurry to do everything.

Is there something you haven't thought of? Maybe it really isn't a big deal. Maybe I can let my mind go.

I heard that the tower was in turmoil, but seeing the situation in front of me, Elena's worries subsided a little.

But soon a group of people came in, and Elena had to tighten her mind again.

“Are you Zich?”

The big-eyed man who came in under the guidance of Wilwes stood in front of Zich.

"Yes."

“Are you Lyle?”

Lyla, who sat across from Zich, nodded.

“I have been instructed to take you away. Disarm now and follow us.”

"Wait!"

Elena shouted. She ran to Wilwes, who was next to the man.

“What happened, Grandpa! These people are innocent!”

“Get out of here, Elena. This is for adults.”

Elena was taken aback by Wilwes' resolute gaze. She flinched back. Wilwes also took his eyes off Elena.

“Can I follow you?”

Zich asked with a smirk. The man frowned, but nodded.

“Give us the arms. We will keep well… .”

“What do you believe?”

Zich cut the man's words and waved his hand to the side. Hans walked over to him.

Zich handed him the magic box, the money he had set aside, and Windur.

“Have a good time.”

"Yes! I will risk my life to protect it!”

Lyla also called Snock and left her wand and belongings.

Zich and Lyla stood up.

“Can I follow you?”

"exactly."

“Go ahead.”

Things went smoothly as Zich and Lyla graciously cooperated.

Those who were worried that Zich and Lyla might rebel, also relaxed a little.

The two followed the man. It was when Zich passed Hans and Snock.

“Good job.”

"Yes."

" Yep."

Hans and Snock quietly answered Zeeke's secret command.

No one heard their conversation.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 246 screen

The place where Zich and Lyla were locked up was in a mansion in a remote area. It wasn't a grand and glamorous place like Dwayne's mansion, but it was a nice enough mansion.

Zich and Lila are locked in separate rooms. It was a room with its own furniture, so there was no discomfort except for the boredom.

However, it was true that the interrogation I received from time to time was a bit annoying.

“Then there must be a reason you went there!”

A scar that extends across the wide shoulder and cheek to the chin. From wild boar-like hair to thick caterpillar-like eyebrows.

Not only children, but even adults with fairly large walls, a man who looked like he would shudder from exhaustion threatened Zich.

It is a method of trying to steal the information you want by killing the spirit of the opponent with a rough appearance even if you pretend to be.

However, for the majority of ordinary people, no, the method that would work enough for those with a certain degree of courage or courage did not work for Zich at all.

"walk."

With his back on the backrest, arms crossed, and legs crossed, Zich gave the answer he had been repeating over and over again. The man's eyebrows twitched.

“•••Are you kidding me now?”

“It’s a joke. Is it a very regrettable judgment? I am cooperating with no self-interest.”

“A walk all of a sudden into a deserted forest outside the city? Do you think those words will work?”

“He’s a really hard-headed guy. People have different personalities. There are extroverts and introverts, and there are people who like the glamor of the city, and there are people who like the ordinary life of the countryside.”

“So you’re saying that you guys like to take a walk in the sparsely populated forest?”

When the man died, Zich said with a smile.

"no. That’s just how I felt.” quaang

The man smashed the table. The table shook and made a loud noise. There were small cracks on the surface. Zich frowned.

“Be noisy. When you hit the table later, signal something. Because I  want to cover my ears first .”

“•••I am so rotten with confidence.”

"then! If I take away my confidence, most of the significance of my existence disappears!”

Wow!

The man grabbed Zich's collar and pulled him away. Surprisingly, Zich was drawn to him with goodwill.

“Hey, you fucking bastard. Be smart.”

The smell of the man's mouth was still there, so Zich covered his nose. The man's expression turned even more grim.

But there was no more violence. I just spit it out like a growl.

"If you believe in the Dwayne's girl and stretch out like this, wake up. No one is defending you now.”

“Are you saying that to us, who are unilateral victims? That’s right, the guys in the tower are rotten.” Despite Zich's boos, the man's attitude did not change.

“Who the hell believes that? The opponent is a prestigious family in Ma Tower. It's also in a state where the heir has reached a state of exhaustion, and his eyes are inverted. On the other hand, you are just floating stones. They seem to have the skills, but that's just that."

“So you’re going to make us scapegoats?”

The man chuckled.

“It doesn’t matter who started the case. I'm sure you will be punished even if the master of the Jaewick family attacked you as you claim. So why are you tortured? If it wasn't for that, things might have been a little better.”

“Are other people in the tower the same idea?”

“I don’t know. Like the Jawicks, they may regard you as a thorn in their eyes, or they may have sympathy for you. One important thing is that I'm not going to face off against the Jaewicks, who have turned around to save a wanderer like you. The blind beast will bite and see whoever it is and how much it hurts.”

“Then why are you doing this? Isn't it enough to simply transfer the death penalty to the death penalty through torture or manipulation?"

The man's expression was slightly distorted. It is the face of a person who does not work out as he intended. Zich laughed bitterly.

“Hey, it looks like Ms. Elena is working hard to say that she and her close friends are still working hard. No, is that what your father is doing?”

“••• Even so, nothing changes.”

The man did not deny it. But it didn't bother me more than necessary.

“It’s just a matter of time. How long can they protect you? Besides, there is only one Orland Dwayne protecting you. The mage master is completely neutral. But it won't last long."

“So what are you asking for? No matter what I say, execution seems inevitable.”

“We want to be comfortable with each other.”

The man laughed bitterly.

“Even if you hold on like this anyway, the only thing waiting for you is terrible torture. Wouldn't it be better to go without pain?"

"Right. It makes a lot of sense.”

As Zich showed a sign of agreement, the man's face brightened at first glance. However, at Zich's next words, the man's brightened face was wrinkled without mercy.

“But I am a really honest person. If you tell a lie, thorns will grow on your tongue.”

Zich sticks out his tongue and moves exaggeratedly.

“So, I don’t think I will accept your offer really unintentionally. But I will keep your kind heart in my heart.”

Whoops!

The man grinded his teeth and pushed Jig off. Zich, who had fallen backwards as if he had lost his center, sat down on the chair naturally. And as before, I crossed my arms and crossed my legs.

“•••He is a guy with a pulpit. Well, that's why he must have tortured Jack Ma, saying he was digging up information."

“I honestly regret it. What are you talking about without even asking how fat you are? How can such a guy pretend to be a giant and flirt? I'm really worried about the future of a place called Mato."

“You don't have to worry. No matter what the future holds for the tower, you will never see it.”

The man turned his back and walked to the door.

“Is today over? There was nothing out of the ordinary. Come play next time. It was surprisingly fun to play with you.”

“The next time you come… .”

With his hand on the handle, the man turned his head. His eerie eyes stared at Zich.

“Probably after the forces protecting you are gone. That time awaits.” thud!

The visit was closed. The sound of the lock closing firmly is heard. And the sound of the man's thumping footsteps disappeared in the distance.

“Oh, you had a good time!”

Zich clasped the back of his head and leaned back against the backrest.

'When you're locked up, there's nothing like making fun of a guard or an interrogator.'

Surprisingly, the current interrogation was nothing more than a game to relieve Zich's boredom for the man who had put a lot of weight on it and tried to get the answer he wanted from Zich.

'If it's necessary, it's a little bit boring to say the least.'

Zich opened his mouth wide and yawned. I put my feet on the table and my arms drooped. No one could see it, and it was just a matter of killing time.

'What is Lila trying to do?'

Zich put magic power around his ears. A voice began to come through the wall. The room where Zich and Lyla were confined was separated, but it was not an obstacle for Zich.

'It seems that the interrogation hasn't been completed yet.'

But, like Zich, the interrogation didn't seem to go well.

The interrogator squeaks and asks a question. But no answer came back. Zich, who understood the situation, chuckled.

'You're doing a dog shit.'

Even if you don't see it, a picture is drawn in your mind. For a moment, I heard the interrogator shout a little more.

thud!

The house rumbled a little. Something hit the floor hard. Zich exploded.

'Lyla, you bastard! You did one thing!'

It was obvious that the Inquisitor, angry at Lyla's attitude, rushed to her, and Lyla just threw the Inquisitor on the floor. Dirty screams signaled that the Inquisitor's pain was unusual.

The door opens and a sign rushes out. Jack laughed for a while.

'Hey, I saw something interesting.'

I doubt whether this should be called a spectacle, but it was fun anyway, so I didn't ask for details. But that was the end of the fun fun.

The interrogator who was interrogating him went out, and the interrogator who was interrogating Lyla also ran away. The surroundings became quiet again.

Zich put only one of the chair's legs on the floor, skillfully balancing it ,  and spinning around.

'Still, I'll have to stay free again for a while.'

But if Zich's guess is correct, it won't last long.

'Come on, let's move. We need to deepen the conflict between Dwayne and Jawick, my friends.'

Soon the darkness will move

Strongly convinced, Zich got up to find another pastime.

After Zich and Lyla were captured, Elena's mood was very depressed. He thought that they were captured because of him.

Moreover, even her grandfather, whom she believed would give her strength, seemed to be one step away from this, which further burned her heart.

Snock's footsteps were also interrupted. Recently, his contract redemption, Knowham, occupied a significant portion of Elena's magic study, but it was also funny to keep going to Dwayne's mansion in such a situation.

Even if he came to the mansion, Elena couldn't see his face because of guilt.

'It will be fine.'

Lost in such a glimmer of hope, she stayed in the mansion all the time. Her grandfather has not come into the house since the incident.

It felt as if the spacious mansion was empty and had become a haunted mansion. Her father, who stopped by from time to time, was only a little comfort in her heart.

Even today, she has no appetite, and after a few rattles of dishes, she wakes up and returns to her room.

After reading the spell book Lyla had bought, the enemy sighed once. I couldn't find the words in the magic book, which I usually enjoyed so much.

I looked out the window and saw the moon in the night sky. Has time passed like this? covered the magic book.

I sat on the bed and looked up at the night sky.

'It was fun back then.'

Not long ago, there was a time when my magic study ended a little late.

When a black veil fell over the sky, she looked up at the night sky with Lyla, Zich, Snock, and No Wet.

Lila, as always, told the myths related to magic and constellations in a gentle voice, while Zich intervened intermittently and burst into laughter.

Snock listened to Lyla with Elena, and Nowtm fell asleep on Elena's lap.

A pleasant memory that seems to be right there when you turn your head. But now, the memory is like a fantasy from a long time ago.

okay. Just like when I was a child, when I had my grandfather, my father, my mother, and I believed that my magic would be released soon.

It was time for Elena to lie down on the bed, wiping away the tears that had welled up.

'•••uh?'

She found an unidentified shadow standing next to her.

(Continued on next page)

Elena gave strength to her body. He moved his arms here and there, and his legs were twitching. But to no avail.

The ropes that tied her body were not weak enough to untie her with her own strength, and even an unidentified human wasn't cluttered enough to lose her in Elena's struggles.

“ 0 eup| OOO town I tried to scream. But the gag holding her mouth shut interrupted her voice.

no means work It was enough to make Elena despair.

But Elena did not give up. Her perseverance and persistence are so great that she continues to study magic while holding on to a glimmer of hope that she may have magical powers too.

Not exhausted, she rebelled. Blood was seeping from her arm, which had been scratched by the rope, but she didn't stop.

Did Elena's rebellion work out? The kidnapper, who was carrying her and jumping over the building, stood up.

“Ugh!” Elena gave strength to her neck with a faint hope in case anyone would hear her moan. Then he looked around.

It's late at night, so the visibility isn't bright. However, it was able to grasp to some extent by the moonlight.

Elena's despair deepened a little. No matter how you look at it, there are no people. The surrounding buildings were also very shabby, so it was unlikely that people would live there.

But she didn't give up. I kept groaning, thinking that maybe, really, there might be people living there. struggled with the body

That was the time. A shadow flickered from the other side of the darkness. It was definitely a human shadow.

Elena's complexion brightened. The stuttering intensified and the moaning continued.

But Elena's hopes were too soon.

“Have you come? stuff?”

When Elena saw the person who came out of the darkness wearing the same robe as the kidnapper, Elena despaired once more.

"we are here."

The kidnapper pointed to Elena. Fellow Rob nodded once and turned his back.

The movement started again. Fellow Rob, who had just appeared, took the lead. But he wasn't the only one who joined. All of a sudden, people wearing the same robes surrounded them.

No matter how tenacious Elena was, she could not squeeze her strength even in this situation. I closed my eyes and trembled at the invisible future.

The group of robes came out of the city through the slightly opened gates as if they had been prepared in advance. And it ran faster than in the city.

It was the moment when Elena thought that even the slightest hope that was left seemed to have disappeared.

“ね!''

Suddenly, the person surrounding Elena stumbled. But even in the midst of it, the strength of the arm holding Elena did not loosen. A very tenacious person. But that too was there.

Aww!

“Great!”

With the sound of pain, the pressure holding Elena disappeared. Her body fell forward.

"town!"

Because his body is tied, he can't even properly defend himself. If he stayed, his face would hit the ground and he would be seriously injured. It was when Elena instinctively closed her eyes.

Shake it!

He felt something soft embrace his body. Elena carefully opened her eyes.

'sand?'

A very fine grain of sand surrounded her.

flash!

light rose Elena closed her eyes again. It was because his eyes, which had been accustomed to darkness, were exposed to a sudden flash of light, and his vision was blocked for a moment.

“Great!”

“Aww!”

A scream was heard. How the hell do things go? It was when she blinked to regain her sight somehow.

“It’s good to close your eyes for the time being.”

The suffocation disappeared from his mouth, and a familiar voice was heard. With a barely freed mouth, Elena spoke the name of the owner of the voice.

“… Snock?”

His name came out naturally without a title of honor because he often learned his face and spoke naturally.

“I don't think there are any serious injuries anywhere. thank God."

coup!

A soft, squishy nib that touches your hand

feeling used to The cute cry we heard together was definitely Nowet's.

“Are you really Snok?”

" right."

“How are you… .”

“Let’s talk later.”

Snock hugged Elena and jumped high.

Whoops!

A cold dagger was stuck where he was.

As time passed, Elena also slowly regained her sight. Blinking eyes filled with tears, he looked at the situation. A light was flashing in front of him. Perhaps that was the light that stole Elena's vision for a while.

Her abductors were engulfed in the light and swung to and fro like a cornered beast.

'Mr. Hans?'

A flash of light shone on the face of the man who was knocking down the robe.

Elena had also seen Hans a few times, so it wasn't difficult to figure out her identity.

Light was bursting from the sword Hans was holding. The light rising against the black night sky literally ravaged the group of robes.

"Oh!"

Elena shouted. Through the light blocking the surroundings like a net, I could see some of the robes running towards Elena and Snok.

The goal was clear to Elena. But Hans didn't pay much attention to them. It continued to fire a bombardment of light only at the enemy in front.

It seemed that the enemies who ran right in front of them would reach out their hands at any moment.

Tuk!

Snock laid Elena aside and pounded her foot on the ground.

Aww!

The ground in front exploded. Scattering sand and pebbles beat those who rushed. Those with wind holes all over their bodies collapsed.

Elena looked at Snock in surprise.

'Did Snok do this?'

I knew that I was a replacement contractor, but how could I use a technology with this level of power so easily?

In the midst of that, Hans certainly blew off the heads of the robes.

- Aaaaaaaaaah!

Suddenly a scream was heard. One of the robes was in a strange condition. The robe, which had been puffy, suddenly tightened.

The body grows and the robes are torn. Even the hood that covered his face was removed, revealing his face.

It wasn't a human face. Unknowingly, Elena swallowed the scream that was about to come out. That was such a terrible sight.

Its body was also much larger than that of a human, and it was no longer considered a human. It runs to Hans.

Do I need to help? Elena turned her head to Snock.

Elena was surprised. Snock had a sad expression on her face to the extent that her worries were instantly relieved.

“Anyway, they all do the same thing.”

'Do you know their identities?'

quaang

At the loud crashing sound, Elena turned her head again.

Hans' shining sword was blocking the monster's attack. It looked a little difficult to frown, but it didn't seem like it was being pushed.

bang! bang! bang!

The clash between Hans and the monster continued. Elena couldn't finish her mouth in that great fight.

I've seen magic demonstrations by high-ranking magicians like my grandfather and father, and I've seen magic duels often, but this was the first time I'd seen such a high-level battle that risked my life.

“Know.”

coo!

Snock's call and Knowwet's answer. After that, the surrounding land stood up.

Aww!

The strides of the robes attacking Hans in cooperation with the monster were dizzy or injured. In some severe cases, their bodies were pierced into the rising earth and they died instantly.

Elena swallowed. I knew Zich and Laila were great, but I'm sure Hans and Snock are like this too.

“Aww. You want to run away?”

It seemed that the robes were slowly retreating, judging that there was no chance of winning. Of course, Hans and Snock had no intention of missing them.

Snock moved his hand.

The earth stood up in a large circle around them. Rising to three or four times the height of a man, they made strong walls.

The robes were bewildered. It was not a height that could not be crossed, but there was inevitably a gap in order to cross the wall. That brief gap was the difference between life and death.

Aww!

- Guruk!

Estelaide pierced the monster's chest. Estelaide slashed the monster, burning the flowing blood with light.

When the most powerful monster fell, there was no way the other robes could stop Hans and Snock.

In the end, some formed a gang and tried to escape the others, but in the end, not one of them was able to get out of the wall that Snock had built due to the skillful siege with Hans, Snock, and even Nowtm.

After finishing the test to see if anyone is alive, Hans and Snock approached Elena. Elena looked at him blankly.

"•••it's okay?"

Snock asked. Knock sniffed from his shoulder.

“Oh, uh, it’s okay.”

“You must have been shocked. But I can't afford to be here right now. I'm sorry Miss Dwayne, but we must move now."

Hans said.

Well, I can't guarantee that there will be no more companions for the kidnappers. Taking a deep breath and exhaling, Elena nodded, calming her heart a little.

“I think so. Let's go to our mansion. No matter what, Granddaughter of Ma Thap-ju, neither grandfather nor father will stand still.”

"It's not possible."

At Hans' strong refusal, Elena's eyes widened.

"uh, ah! The kidnappers may be hiding on the way to the mansion. And it was at home that I was kidnapped. A mansion without grandpa can be dangerous. Then to the horse tower or my father's mansion... .”

“Neither does that.”

“Or someone I know is an acquaintance of my grandfather. Going to him will definitely help... .”

Seeing Hans shake her head, Elena shut her mouth.

“Then where are you going?”

“We have a place we have prepared for you. Let’s go there.”

“… Excuse me, but I can't believe it's a safer place than the one I mentioned."

"I'm sorry, but it doesn't matter how safe the places Miss Dwayne mentioned are."

The atmosphere back is weird. Elena looked at Snock. He was smoking some other blue. Norwet didn't even make eye contact with her.

“Uh, you guys didn’t come to save me… yo. This?"

Hans silently stated his mission.

“We are here to kidnap Miss Dwayne.”

The estelaide that Hans was holding seemed to gleam.

After Zich flirted with the Inquisitor, there were no further interrogations. It looked like he was going to start moving in earnest after gaining the authority to conduct a slightly stronger interrogation.

Of course, Zich didn't care about that at all. Rather, his greatest enemy was boredom.

Zich, who was engaged in a desperate struggle with an enemy who was freed from magical powers, did simple physical training, and somehow boredom, listened to the outside world.

A little commotion and clutter could be felt through the window blocked by thick gratings.

'Okay.'

Jack smiled brightly. Hans and Snock must have faithfully carried out their orders.

'I'm going to get out of here too.'

It's comfortable, but I prefer to run back and forth by myself.

Zich opened his ears. And I began to overhear the stories of people moving around me. After a while, I was able to capture the conversation I wanted.

- Did you hear that? It is said that the granddaughter of the master mato is gone.

It's the conversation between the guards outside Zich's door. Jack knocked on the door.

"What!"

One of the guards asked through the door.

“I just heard about it. Elena Dwayne is gone?”

Zich said in a serious voice, but with a smile on his face.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 248 screen

You may not know that all the inquisitors were just pouring out harsh words, but the places where Zich and Lyla were locked up were not all hostile to them.

In order to prepare for the runaway of the Jaewick family that might occur, the man was planted by Matapju.

Through them, Zich was able to inform the master of his intentions.

Reunited, Wilwes seemed much older during that brief period. Although his body was old, he seemed to have lost even the eyes that were shining with guns.

“ I  heard you said you were helping find Elena .”

"That's right."

Ziek said solemnly.

“Elena was very affectionate as a disciple of a close friend. So when I heard that she was missing, I couldn't stay still. So was my friend.”

Lyla, who was next to him, said with a firm face.

“Even if the period of teaching is short, he is my disciple. He is a very good and wonderful disciple, so I heard it especially quickly. How can you stand still when such a child is missing?”

"•••Right."

“I think you know our skills to some extent. There is also a traveler's unique experience. At least it won't get in the way.”

Jack said confidently.

“••• Do you know your position?”

“I think it’s because of Jaewick.”

"exactly. They cannot stand still.”

“I want you to listen and not misunderstand what I am saying, Lord Matthew.”

Zich made eye contact with Wilwes.

“How likely are they to cause this incident?”

“What do you mean by those who kidnapped Elena?”

Wilwes' tone went down.

Doubts about the noble family of the tower. It was never something to be taken lightly.

“Be careful with your words. If Wayne Jawick had heard it, he wouldn't have stood still."

“Wayne Jawick. The head of the Zawick family, right? He’s also the father of the idiot I knocked down.”

“I told you to be careful. this is the tower As a traveler, I can respect a certain amount of freedom, but I cannot tolerate rude remarks!”

“Excuse me.”

As Wilwes spoke strongly, Zich politely apologized.

“But, my lord. don't they have a criminal record? They ridiculed and despised Elena, but they had an unsuccessful argument and were defeated in a duel with Laila here, so they took a sneak peek. I think it's enough to bring a grudge against Elena for the reason she's been in a miserable situation.”

“Ummm… .”

Even Wilwes could not deny Zich's words here.

“Looking at the reaction, it seems that the Lord Matthew also has a degree of grievance.”

“I will admit that. It's probably because your case hasn't happened in a while. But still, I can't doubt it. There is no evidence and it is difficult to conclusively conclude that they are the culprits psychologically.”

“But you can put pressure on the Jawick.”

Wilwes glanced at Zich.

“I wanted that.”

“No matter how much I tortured the Jaewick master and left him in a state of disrepair, he is definitely alive. That's the one that started first. But I don't even know what state Elena is in right now."

Wilwes moaned displeasedly. But Zich didn't care.

“The reason we were able to detain us was because the incident we committed was such that the Jaewick family would lose their last name. If you interfere, anyone will unconditionally bite you. Others wouldn't want to care. It must have been one of the factors that we, as opponents, were drifters. But now, I'm sorry to say this, but there's an incident that caused Dwayne to lose this last name. No matter how much the wolf rolls its eyes and runs wildly to bite everything around it, if a tiger appears with the same eyes turned in front of you, there is no choice but to hesitate.”

Zich looked into Wilwes' eyes. It was as if he was trying to look into his feelings.

“Reason, are you staying?”

“•••It is on the verge of being cut off.”

Willwes said with a momentum that, if there was a criminal in front of him, he would break his neck at any moment.

“Then it won’t be difficult.”

“But I am the master of the tower. I can't proceed on the basis of my personal feelings.”

Zich looked at Wilwes.

Is it really your intention, or is there something else on your mind? From his face, he could only read the feelings of concern for Elena and the duty of the Lord of the Tower.

“Anyway, our work must have started from personal emotions. However, if Master Ma Thap says so, it is not that there is no other way. I heard that Elena's father was quite friendly with us. And he must have been one of those who died.”

“You mean to use your son as a shield?”

“At least he has little reason to stay neutral.”

Sieg knew that Orland had already protected them. It wasn't too difficult to get information because rumors were circulating between the three.

"How is it?"

“•••Are you sure you won't run away?”

“I can’t tell you anything but trust me.”

Wilwes thought for a moment. After that, he nodded as if he had made up his mind.

“I will try my best.”

“You won’t regret it.”

Zich said so in a very trusting voice.

* * *

“Free!”

In the wind outside after a long time, Zich stretched out his arms and said cheerfully. Although Laila did not express it outwardly, she seemed to be in a very good mood.

“What are you going to do now?”

"We'll have to call Hans or Snock to find out what's going on." Zich's command to his servants is not one thing. He predicted several things that would happen in the future and told them different ways to respond to each situation.

“Looking at the situation now, someone was trying to kidnap Elena. And they snatched it up as ordered.”

“Are they really protecting Elena?”

Lyla was worried that she might have been kidnapped in a really harsh place.

“You heard from the master. There were signs of kidnapping inside the house, and the bodies of an unidentified group in robes were found on the outskirts of the castle. And there were people who witnessed the light flashing over the wall. It must have been the light of Estellade.”

“Then I’m glad.”

“Trust these guys. He must have done well.”

It was still a feeling of trust in the servants.

Zich chuckled.

“The reason for trying to kidnap Elena was probably to intensify the conflict between the Dwayne and the Jawick. But, was he actually kidnapped by someone who didn’t know who Elena was?” Such a smile that will make you feel sad if anyone who knows Zich's nature sees it.

Lyla also took a step away from Zich.

“Perhaps the black man is very upset right now. The result went his way, but Elena Dwayne was not in his hands. And the kidnappers they sent were annihilated. Oh, I don't know who he is, but I need to see his face now."

He was also willing to pay thousands of dollars if possible.

Zich continued to hear a grim laughter.

it went Lyla took another step away from Zich. He shook his head and sighed.

* * *

Zich entered the dormitory. Even if Zich and Lyla were captured, their room remained intact.

Because Hans was constantly paying rent to rent the house. It cost a lot of money, but it didn't hurt the Zich and the others to spend that much.

“Are you here!”

Hans greeted them deeply and welcomed them.

"OK."

After giving a simple answer, Zich held out his hand. Hans hurriedly held out Windur and Sieg's belongings.

Zich grabbed Windur and swung it lightly. I missed this weight because I haven't seen it in a while.

“Isn’t this guy doing anything wrong?”

I don't know if it hides its master like Estellade, but it is a sword that ignores even the words of its owner, Zich, except when it is necessary with some will.

I've seen that Hans can wield Windur, but there's a good chance he's screwed up Hans in another way.

"No, I don't know if it's because I haven't touched it much, but it wasn't anything to worry about. It didn't matter much when I moved or cleaned it for a while.”

"okay?"

Doesn't he choose the owner like Estelaide? However, he didn't even know that Windur had not been angry for a while, recognizing that the current situation was necessary.

'I'll have to check it out next time.'

Zich put Windur on his back. When my weight was placed on my back, a strange sense of satisfaction arose.

Lyla also received her belongings from Hans. It seems that she was also awkward to handle the wand as she let go of what she always carried with her.

Even if Zich pulled a chair, he sat in front of Hans.

“Report.”

“Once we succeeded in abducting Miss Dwayne.”

Lila's complexion brightened.

“Isn’t that kid hurt?”

“I got abrasions on my arm from being swept away by the rope that tied me, but I am healthy. The injuries were caused by those who first kidnapped Miss Elena.”

After hearing that Elena was injured, Lyla's expression turned a little harsh, Hans quickly added.

“Who was it?”

Jack asked. Hans answered without hesitation, as if he had already expected a question to arise.

“They were robes.”

"also."

It was expected when I heard that the corpses found outside the city were wearing robes.

“According to Zich's advice, we are monitoring the Dwayne mansion in the evening, and the guy who kidnapped Miss Dwayne came out of the mansion. I sneaked behind him and knocked them all down like Snock outside the castle.”

“Are you sure about the robes?”

“The movements were similar to those I have met so far. Most of all, one of them turned into a monster and came rushing in.”

there is no way to know Wasn't it the technique(?) used by the head of the robes?

“Who missed it?”

“At least all of the guys I was working with have been dealt with.”

Zich laughed bitterly.

“You’ve grown a lot. The guy who used to struggle with even a single robe.”

“Isn’t it because of Zich-sama?”

Hans smiles slightly in return. Considering the fact that he was a servant who moved while paying attention to Zich's words, it was a really surprising development.

Sieg was also satisfied with Hans's growth. However, Zich chinked at him to continue the report without showing it.

“I thought of tortured them to get information, but I thought it was useless against them.”

"Well done. They are the ones who will not open their mouths to torture.”

“Ms. Dwayne has moved to the place she has chosen. It will not be easy to find.”

“Did you follow along?”

“I take it with a lot of resistance.

I struggled a bit.”

“I will.”

Elena Dwayne is the one who has a single temper now, though nothing is happening now, so she lives in a spirited state.

He remembered him as a very flaming person like the magic he used as his main force.

“Now Snock is with us.”

“Boy, you’re going to have a hard time.”

Zich thought of Snock and clicked his tongue.

that time.

“Calm down, Elena!”

"Calm? Now I really look!”

In a certain place, Elena and Snock were facing each other with a table in between.

Snok tries to calm Elena with both hands. But as Snock approached half a step, Elena shouted out loud.

“Don’t come near me! I'm really going to stab you!”

The silver fork in her hand glistens.

Seeing this, the hostage, who had been caught tightly in Elena's arm, screamed in terror.

Woo woo woo woo!

Knowwet's eyes turned to the fork Elena was holding. It is not a tool designed to harm living things.

But a few sharp blades were enough to rip through the skin and dig into the muscles. Elena's hand moved, bringing the fork a little closer.

Knowwem looked at Snock. and shouted

woo woo woo!

Snock grabbed his head. How did this happen?

It started with meal time. First of all, it is impossible to prepare a meal for the kidnapped Elena, so Snock prepared the meal as long as they were with her.

Most of the meal preparation was left to Snock, who often stayed in this secret place.

Elena had resisted quite a bit up until the kidnapping, but once she succeeded in imprisoning her, she cooperated surprisingly well. It seems that he was careless for a while.

Nowem, who was on the table, sniffing in anticipation, waiting for his share of food to arrive.

Then, secretly, Elena came to the table. Even if she was kidnapped, she was only forbidden to go outside, but was able to roam freely inside.

Neither Snock nor Knowtt thought she was just coming to the table to eat.

As they thought, Elena pulled the chair back as if trying to sit down at the table. However, the next action was unexpected.

Feel good ku! coup! Elena snatched Knowwet as she sprinted and tapped the table with her front paws. With the other hand, he picked up the fork that had been set on the table.

And this is the situation that came out.

Snock looked at Elena. Her face was very stiff.

“Mom, don’t think you can’t! I'm not in a position to cover this up right now either! You can really poke!”

Big oooot phrase—!—' । —— । —■ r! As the fork got a little closer, Knowwem screamed louder. Snock sighed.

"what do you want?"

“Get me out!”

'Yes.'

Frankly, that was a stupid question. Is there anything else a forcibly kidnapped person wants? But that was an unacceptable question.

"No."

“Ugh!”

Snock shook her head resolutely, and Elena bit her lip. Fork moved a little closer to Knowwet.

“Gee, I’m really going to stab you!”

But even as he said that, Elena's hand holding the fork was trembling. It's not because I'm afraid of Snock's intimidation.

'It's not easy to kill.'

Even if it is not a human being, the consciousness that it will end life certainly makes you feel reluctant.

In addition, a know-how is a beast that understands human speech and has high intelligence. In addition, by providing magical power to Elena, she also built up a bond.

"stop. There is no gain for you by doing that.”

“The damage of being trapped here can be eliminated!”

“Do you really think you can kill Wet?”

Elena didn't respond.

“As you know, know is the number of the earth. Its power is enough to be easily dealt with by any knight or magician. Do you even know what kind of being the earthly lord is?”

She knew so well about the return of the earth that she recognized at a glance that Nowet was the return of the earth.

At least it was clear that he, who could not even use magic, was not strong enough to win with a fork.

He was trembling at Elena's fork, but it was possible because Knowwet didn't think of Elena as an enemy.

Had Knowwet recognized Elena as an enemy, she would have died immediately.

But Elena couldn't just walk away.

“•••You don't know what to do with me. If you are going to cause any trouble to your grandfather or father... .”

There was poison in Elena's eyes. Snock clicked inwardly.

'Originally, I said that I had one personality.'

I thought I would kill myself if I didn't do something.

“•••Honestly, I don't even know the exact plan.”

Snock shrugged.

“But at least it won’t hurt you.”

“How can you believe that!”

“Would you believe it if it wasn’t me, but Lyla-sama?”

Elena's body stopped abruptly. Her eyes fluttered.

“•••Is the teacher involved too?”

It was expected. Snock had been introduced to Zich and Lyla. If such Snock had caused the kidnapping, of course, there was a high probability that it was related to the two of them.

But she desperately ignored that possibility. I just wished it was just the two of us, Hans and Snock.

He didn't want to accept the fact that Lyla had betrayed him. But Snock's words shattered her hopes.

“First of all, Lyla-sama didn’t betray you. You know that? How much he loves you.”

“Then  why are you doing this!”

Elena shouted. A sense of anger and betrayal mixed desperately in her voice.

Snock answered calmly.

“To protect you.”

Elena stiffened at the unexpected sound.

“As I said before, I don’t know for sure. But I know there's some conspiracy going on with you in this city right now. Now Zeek is trying to dig it up.”

“  Are you going to believe that  ?”

“There was a force trying to kidnap you.”

Elena remembered the robes who had kidnapped her from the mansion.

“After receiving orders from Zich, we continued to monitor your mansion. Because there was a possibility that someone kidnapped you.”

“… It could be the people who are weaving with you.”

“Are you going to kill all those people?” Perhaps Snock's persuasion worked or Elena's hand, which was holding Know Wet, weakened a little. Now let out a sigh of relief.

There was a gap, but there was no attempt to forcefully escape from Elena's hand. In the first place, you could escape whenever you wanted.

“If you are still in doubt, Zich told me to show you this.”

Snock pulled something out of his pocket and threw it at Elena. Elena struggled with the sudden action.

Her hand whirled through the air, but it was hard to catch what Snok threw.

coup!

At that moment, Knowwem, who removed her body from Elena's arm, flew into the air. No Webb slammed Snock's throw with his mouth and landed on Elena's shoulder.

coup! coup!

Asking to take it, Knowwem presses it on Elena's shoulder.

Elena was somewhat embarrassed by the kindness of Hwansu, who had just been held hostage. However, he nodded his head slightly and received the item.

"This… .”

“A brooch that refers to Carwiman’s honorary paladin.”

Elena's eyes widened.

“Honor Paladin?”

Elena knows that the honorary paladin is too. She hurriedly looked at the brooch.

“•••Is this real?”

" Really."

“Who is the honorary genitalia?”

“Jeek.”

Elena narrowed her eyes.

“… Mr. Zich?”

"know. It would be hard to believe.”

Snock is one of the people who can see, hear, and feel Zich's personality up close.

He recognized and acknowledged that Zich's personality was far from what people thought of as an honorary paladin of Carwiman.

“But it’s true. Zich-sama has a bad personality, but at least he only does bad things to bad guys. Carwiman's Honor Paladin was obtained by helping Carwiman in subjugating Valede."

However, Elena's suspicious eyes did not disappear. Snock was very upset.

"Really! Because it was given by the saint himself!”

“Lady? Have you met the Lady of Carwiman?”

Elena showed interest. Snock rejoiced like an animal being pursued by a hunter looking for an escape route. He told Elena a little bit about her adventures.

“•••Has anything like that ever happened?”

"okay. Nana-senpai, I'm talking about Mr. Hans. We're both pretty strong, but Zich and Laila-sama are so strong that they're really different."

'By the way, these people were travelers.'

He was kidnapped and imprisoned in an unknown place, but his curiosity could not be stopped. I'd love to hear more about your travel stories.

'Should I believe it for now?'

Of course, I didn't think that way because of a single immature desire to hear about travel.

Looking at it objectively, I couldn't think of a way to escape from this place. Moreover, it was also true that her heart was softened by the token of Carwiman's honorary paladin, which is now in her hand.

"•••great. I'll trust you right now."

Elena wrapped her hand around the wet, which was still on her shoulder, and carefully stretched it out near the table.

coup!

Knowh jumped off the table. Snock was relieved.

'I was worried about how to make us believe, but luckily it worked out.'

I didn't know if I would start with a hostage play, though.

“What do you say is the price of trust, but can you tell me what kind of trip you guys have been on?”

“It’s not that difficult.”

Snock nodded.

“Oh, come to think of it, there was something Lyla-sama said.”

“What do you  mean ?”

“Don’t neglect your magic practice. I'm telling you to keep using Nowet's magic and keep getting used to it."

"•••okay. Studying is not allowed.”

I still can't definitively trust Zee and the others. However, Elena couldn't stop smiling when she was told to continue studying magic.

"okay. For the time being, I will focus on studying magic.”

“Then are you done with understanding?”

" for now."

"great."

Snock left the table for a while, then set the prepared food on the table and said.

“Then let’s eat first.”

As the relationship between Snock and Elena had calmed down, Snoowick's confusion was increasing.

Doubts arose over Elena's disappearance and the mysterious corpses found outside the castle.

Rumors spread to the general public as well, and when two or three people gathered, they were busy talking about it. All sorts of speculations and rumors abounded.

Zich and Lila returned to their dorms. During the day, he pretended to be looking for Elena and wandered around the city. Of course, Elena was never to be found.

Once the position that Jawick was a key player in the case did not disappear, they had to inform the person dispatched to the dormitory every evening that they had not escaped.

The two went up to the dorm after putting their faces on the guards. Lyla entered Zich's room.

"What are you doing?"

Lyla, who came in to discuss her future work, asked when Zich was writing something.

Jack smiled brightly. Lyla noticed right away. I know that what Zich is doing right now will never be a bad thing.

“Did we kidnap Elena?”

Like a naughty prankster boasting of his little joke, Zich clapped his hands and said.

"okay. That got Snoowick upside down.”

“Originally, kidnapping is mostly used to intimidate those who are related to the kidnapped target rather than the kidnapped target. like a hostage. Think about it, Lyla. There has been a 'abduction case of the granddaughter of Matapju', which is now rife with all kinds of speculations and rumors. Not a single thing has been revealed about the kidnappers, their intentions, anything related to the bodies outside the walls, etc. The family, the darkness, and everyone involved must somehow have their eyes wide open to find a clue. What do you need at this time?”

"What?"

He grabbed the paper that Zich was writing and fluttered. And he said it very happily.

“It’s time for the blackmail to appear.”

(Continued on next page)

Zich hummed and turned the pen back and forth. Lyla stood behind Zich, staring at the unfinished blackmail.

“Do you have anything to ask for, too? If there's anything you want, tell me. Money, magic books, or treasures. In any case, you can ask for a dance in front of the tower on a bright moonlit night. We are holding our granddaughter's life.”

"does not exist. What on earth does it mean to write something like that in what kind of blackmail letter?”

"joke."

“… You'll never die pretty."

“Even if that were the case, I wouldn’t give up on my way of life.”

“Don’t wrap simple garbage as a philosophy of life!”

“Lyla says. Ma Thap-ju, don’t package my garbage as a philosophy of life… ”

“What are you using!” Zich quickly avoided Lyla's palm. It was surprisingly fast and flexible.

Lyla swung her palms a few more times, but Zich diddged them all by moving only his upper body.

“No matter how good you are at punching, you can’t do anything to me to that extent.”

Zich snapped his fingers. However, when he saw Lyla being honest and holding her wand, she calmly straightened herself.

“What did you write?”

After staring at Zich for a while and calming her mind with a few deep breaths, Lyla put down her wand and asked. Of course, he didn't forget to slap Zich on the back hard before that.

“It’s not great. No, I have no intention of asking for anything right now.”

Zich said, rubbing the back of his hand with the back of his hand.

“We kidnapped Elena and fed him one shot, but that doesn’t mean we didn’t know her identity.”

“Then why are you writing a blackmail letter?”

“Of course, I’m going to go out to discover the true identity of the darkness. To catch a fish, you have to keep throwing the bait.”

Zich lifted the blackmail. There were a few short letters written on it.

“This is it for now. For the rest, we'll have to write a blackmail letter while watching what's going on."

Zich was called by Willwes. It was called Wilwes' mansion. It was early in the morning that Wilwes called him because it was quite urgent.

Zich got his meal and headed to the mansion.

The user was hit by a jig. As if it had already been said, they led Zich directly into the drawing room.

It must have happened that the mansion itself was enveloped in a strange urgency.

'Well, it's probably because of the blackmail I sent.'

Unlike Yongin, who had a strangely hard face due to the tension surrounding the mansion and Elena's worries even without showing off, Zich was very easygoing.

People had already gathered in the drawing room.

Wilwes was at the forefront, and Orland and a few strangers were sitting.

“Are you here? Come this way.”

Wilwes put Zich next to him.

“Maybe everyone here knows. He is the one who caused a lot of commotion these days.”

People gave their eyes of agreement. Occasionally, there were people who gave me curious glances.

“Since we are all wizards, there is a possibility that the view of the case will be biased. So that's why I called this person. As a prosecutor and as a traveler, it will give us a perspective we have never seen before.”

Willwes motioned for an empty seat, and Jigg bowed his head slightly and sat down where Will Weiss was pointing.

“You are very easygoing. I never knew that a traveler would be the last.”

someone is sarcastic Zich looked towards the source of the voice.

The person sitting diagonally from where Zich was sitting was looking at him. The eyes looking at Zich are unusual.

was the first person I saw. But it was easy to find out who he was. I've heard of his appearance, and more than anything else, I can only think of one Willwes official who would give Zich that bloody glance.

"It's my first time seeing you, Mr. Wayne Jawick."

Jik smiled softly and continued with the next words.

“Is your son well?”

Whoops!

Wayne clenched his fists. It looks like he wants to kill Zich with his fist right now. But Zich was calm. Rather, he looked at him with the light of his eyes, wondering what to do.

“This dog… !”

It was time for Wayne to become impatient and begin to swear.

“Stop it. Now is the time to fight!”

Wayne was stopped by the person next to him. Wayne shut his mouth. He looked at Zich as if he was about to tear it apart, and then turned his head.

“Please be patient. Now is not the time to argue. please."

Orland, who was sitting a little further away from Zich, said. Zich also looked away from Wayne and nodded.

As the crowd calmed down, Wilwes spoke up.

“First of all, I want to say thank you to those who have gathered here.”

His voice was very tired. It was a voice that could make sense of how much he had suffered recently.

“Thank you so much for rushing to find my granddaughter even though it’s not your job.”

Wilwes bowed his head. Others panicked and quickly stopped him.

“How many times have you suffered for the sake of Matthew, but you only bowed your head over this?”

"That's right. Besides, if you don't help in times like these, how can you be called a friend of the same tower?"

“Thank you so much.”

Wilwes once again thanked the people and explained why he had called them in.

“Actually, I got this yesterday.”

When Wilwes gave the signal, a man dressed as a butler entered. He was holding a silver tray.

The butler carefully placed the silver tray on the table. People's eyes focused on the silver tray.

There was a torn envelope and a piece of paper that was supposed to be inside the envelope.

"What is this?"

asked the person sitting right next to Wilwes. Wilwes sighed and spoke in a voice full of anger.

“It looks like a letter from the one who kidnapped Elena.”

people were screaming

“Can I read it?”

"Okay."

Orland listened carefully to the letter.

“What is written?”

someone asked Orland stared at the letter as if it was about to eat it, then slowly opened his mouth.

“We have Elena Dwayne with us.”

People swallowed the saliva. It was too short, but that's why it was a more explicit sentence.

Some closed their eyes, some held their wrath, and some frowned. And everyone waited for Orland to speak.

But Orland put the letter down.

“This is the end.”

" what?"

People were bewildered. The person sitting next to him quickly picked up the letter and examined it closely.

I looked at the front, looked at the back, and looked up and down backwards. But there was really only one sentence written down.

“What… .”

“It’s really just one sentence.”

People who looked at the letter muttered as if it were ridiculous.

“Isn’t this just a joke?”

It was only natural for such opinions to arise. But Wilwes shook his head.

“It was on the table in the garden. Some crazy guy sneaks into our house at this time of the day and plays tricks.”

People nodded. Unless you're really dying to die, you wouldn't play such a prank at this time.

“Then there is a very high probability that the criminal sent it… .”

people are in trouble

“What the hell did you send me this letter for?”

“There are no requirements and no criminal statement. Did you really risk breaking into Dwayne's mansion just to say this one thing?" It couldn't be explained intuitively. They were the smartest people in the world to know, but they were troubled by letters with only one sentence.

The letter that circulated from people's hands was also delivered to Zich. Zich frowned and looked at the letter as if thinking about it.

But it was only the appearance. Deep down, I was really thinking of a good idea.

'I wrote it, but I wrote it very strangely.' I really twisted it when I wrote it so I wouldn't get caught with my handwriting. It wasn't difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence, but it wasn't even a good handwriting.

Of course, it didn't matter to anyone.

Last but not least, everyone checked the letters. Zich placed the letter back on the silver tray on the table.

“Now I would like to hear your opinion on the letter.”

Wilwes asked, but no one was quick to speak. What the hell did you mean by writing this?

“Isn’t that a show off?”

A wizard spoke first.

"splurge?"

“Yes, show off. Literally, it's bragging. They say they are slaughtering Dwayne.”

“Isn’t that too unrealistic? What are you doing to do such a useless thing?”

Someone countered that. But Zich agreed.

“It's not very likely.”

People's eyes were drawn There was one very unpleasant gaze, but Zich silently ignored them. To be honest, I didn't even care.

“While traveling, I met quite a few people, some of whom I didn't really understand. It is not a tale of a madman who gets satisfaction from bragging about his crimes to the victim's family.”

"her! What such!”

People clicked their tongues.

“Then you mean this is the work of a madman?”

When Orland asked, Zich shook his head.

“It is a matter of 'there is a possibility' to some extent. I can't say for sure under the current circumstances."

“Then it could be for a different purpose.”

“Isn’t there a plot up for something?”

A different opinion emerged.

“It’s like turning our gaze away, or changing our plans based on our actions.”

“That also makes sense.”

So people kept exchanging opinions. There are few clues, so I am not sure that 'this is the correct answer', but there were a few opinions that seemed highly likely.

If it was an achievement, it was an achievement, so Wilwes' expression brightened a little.

It was around the time when it seemed that this meeting was going to end soon after sharing so many opinions.

“What opinion do you have?”

Wayne suddenly asked Zich.

“Matap Master wanted a completely new perspective, so I called you, but you didn’t give any opinions.”

“He was very involved in the discussion.”

Orland defended him. But Wayne snorted.

“At best, I put a spoon on other people’s opinions. It doesn't live up to the expectations that called him. Didn't you call him to hear opinions we hadn't come up with with a completely different perspective?"

“Look. Moderately… .”

It was time for others to stop again.

Jack smiled brightly.

“It’s a completely different perspective… . Well, it is not.”

"•••what?"

Wayne was confused. The people who were looking at the situation with a mixture of concern and irritation at the prospect of a fight again opened their eyes and looked at Zich.

Zich opened his mouth very slowly, as if smirking.

“Let’s change our mind and think about it. We thought this blackmail was a message to us, to be more precise, to Ma Thap. But what if not?”

Looking towards the pair of eyes that were directed at him, Zich quietly exhaled.

“This message could be a message to someone else who is not the owner of the mage.”

(Continued on next page)



# No. 251 screen

“It’s not a message to me. What do you mean?”

Will Weiss was a bit bewildered by the completely different interpretation from before. The other people looked at each other's faces and whispered a little.

“The stories that have come out so far have only talked about the person who kidnapped Elena or the group.”

“To find the kidnapped Miss Dwayne,

in place. What the hell are you doing with something like that?”

Wayne Jawick grumbled again. Zich looked at him and smiled slightly. And he spoke in a very kind and gentle tone.

“Why don’t you just listen to what people have to say? You ask a question and you grumble every time you try to answer it. To some, it may seem like a ignorant author who deliberately quarrels with an emergency like this.”

“What!”

Wayne looked at Zich like a seizure. He hadn't expected that such a blatant reply would come. But Zich's words didn't end there.

“Of course, that's not to say that Mr. Jawick has such thoughts. He is a man who humbly acknowledged his son's sick deeds. I think he is a very good person for his children's education, except for running a little bit.”

"this person… !”

Wayne was experiencing in real time the adage that when you get too angry, you can't even speak properly.

“So, you must have interrupted me unintentionally because you were so curious. It's not like you've done anything ignorant to say that you're arguing in an urgent situation like this. If you are a common-sense person who had an argument with Mr. Jawick's son and I, and that son unilaterally quarreled and got a dog smashed, then of course he must not have a bad feeling because of the incident where he should be reprimanded. It wouldn’t be much more difficult to drag it all the way out of here like a headshot.”

jump!

Wayne stood up. He reached out to pick up the cane that was standing next to him. His lips trembled and he was ready to memorize the chant right away.

“Come on, wait! Wait, jae-wick!”

The wizard who was next to Wayne quickly grabbed Wayne's arm that was outstretched toward the staff.

“Really! What are you trying to do here!”

“Let it go! I'm going to kill him right now!"

Wayne scrambled to get rid of the wizard hanging from his arm, but the old wizard couldn't stand the weight of a single man.

But he didn't stop writhing. Others also began to dry him.

However, his nerve cords were not thick enough to tolerate the scoldings of a wanderer who dared not know the origins, and that also made his son a scoundrel.

Koo!

But a sudden loud noise stopped him from rioting.

People's eyes are directed towards the sound. Will Weiss was there, staring at people as he had hit the table.

The scorching eyes of the mage tower stare at people. Wayne, who was raging with anger, as well as everyone else, was stingy.

“•••Now we are talking about my granddaughter. Please refrain from saying anything other than that, at least for the time being. I beg you.”

Words are a request, but fortunately, there was no big, bad-headed human who would accept those words as a simple request. Wayne put down his wand and sat quietly in his seat.

“Keep talking.”

“It is.”

As if he had nothing to do with the serious atmosphere, Zich answered calmly.

An absurd glance flew and pierced him, but Zich didn't care either.

“How long have I been talking about?”

“I even mentioned that we only talked about those who kidnapped Elena.”

“It was. With that said, we only talked about the person who directly kidnapped Elena. But let's put one more in the middle here.”

“What kind of being are you talking about?”

“On the day Elena was kidnapped, unidentified bodies in robes were found outside the city walls.”

People nodded.

“It was definitely a suspicious case. Even outside the city walls, no body has been found that died in such a mass.”

“I heard that the identity was not revealed even during the investigation.”

“I've heard that they are a suspicious group of people wearing robes on every outward appearance. They said it could be some sort of criminal group or an assassin.”

People exchanged opinions.

Wilwes opened his mouth heavily.

“Of course we thought they might have something to do with those who kidnapped Elena. But even so, they would be hostile to the kidnappers of Elena.”

“You think the two of them collided, and the group that wore the robes lost.”

“What do you think?”

"no. I am of the same opinion.”

“It’s suspicious, but anyway, I thought it had little to do with rescuing Elena, so I turned it off for now. So will other people.”

Zich attended this meeting for the first time today, but there must have been a number of other meetings before Zich attended.

At that time, it seemed that an unspoken promise to put off the Robe group had already been made.

“As I just mentioned, the group that kidnapped Elena and the group of dead robes are highly likely to be hostile. So, from now on, I will speak on the premise that the two groups fought each other to death outside the castle over who will occupy Elena.”

It was not an unreasonable guess, so people did not object. Zich held the letter placed on the silver tray again between his index and middle fingers and shook it lightly.

“The content of this letter is provocative even if you pretend to. It must have pissed off Lord Matap and Mr. Dwayne, who had kidnapped our granddaughter and daughter, and, moreover, others working together to find Elena. including me. I think there must be some provocation intention in this letter.” Wilwes exhaled heavily, and Orland lightly grinded his teeth.

“But if you think about it, there is another group that will be offended by this provocative phrase.”

“•••A group of robes that failed to kidnap Elena.”

“That’s it.”

Zich looked at Orland and nodded as if praising the student who answered his question correctly.

“As Dwayne said. Still, the kidnapping of Elena failed and considerable casualties were suffered, but if the other party insists that Elena is there, the Rob group will be very angry. In that sense, this phrase could be a message to the Grove community.”

“What nonsense… . Even if you're right, why are you sending that letter to the lord?"

Said the man who seemed to be upset.

“If you want to send it, you have to send it to the group of groves. No matter how good a message is, if it is not delivered to the person to whom it should be delivered, it will be useless.”

"Sure. I agree. But what if it was delivered very well?”

“It was delivered well. This letter was addressed to Ma Thap-ju, not to the location of the Robe group's colleague... .”

For a moment, the person who was speaking made an astonished expression on his face. But for a moment, his face became red. He had a very angry face.

“Are you suspicious of Mt. You say that the mage is a friend of the robes?”

shock subsided. The one who spoke, as well as the others, looked at Zich with angry faces.

For some, the twitching of their fingers made it seem like they wanted to pick up a wand at any moment.

“•••Are you doubting me?”

Surprisingly, the master's voice was calm. But his eyes were staring straight into Zich's eyes.

“It is not.”

“If not, what do you mean?”

“Isn’t there again? Those who have come to know the purpose of this letter.”

Zich averted his gaze from the master's eyes. And without hiding his displeasure yet, rather, he made eye contact with the people who were looking at him, one by one.

The action meant one thing.

“•••Are you suspicious of us?”

He was the one who got mad at Wilwes. Now his face was like an apple. Instinctively or intentionally, the wand was clenched in his hand.

Naturally, the displeasure of others also jumped. There were people who went beyond the harshness to a quiet life.

Zich shrugged. But he didn't give up his opinion.

“It was an unpleasant opinion, so I tried to talk about it cautiously when more evidence was gathered later, but that’s how it turned out.”

“Answer the question! Are you suspicious of us?”

The feeling of pressure tightening towards the jig. But Zich was not someone who bends just because he presses hard. On the contrary, it only reacts more.

"Yes."

The harshness disappeared in an instant at Zich's so calm words. It was absurd, so I was in a state of emotional emptiness for a while. It's like the sea drains out before a tsunami comes.

But for a while. Like a tidal wave that filled the void and came up to the land and swept away everything, great anger poured out.

"this person! If so, wouldn't you be suspicious too!"

"Yes. I am also a suspect.”

"•••what'?"

Once again the anger broke down. They could not comprehend Zich's behavior in admitting that he was also a suspect so easily.

Zich clapped lightly. It was an act to evoke the atmosphere.

“Don't get too excited. I don't think my opinion is correct either. It's just one of many opinions. I would appreciate it if you could just think, 'There are opinions like this'."

And smiled single by one.

The harsh atmosphere had subsided. The eyes on Zich never changed to favor.

The point where you could just burst out in anger twice has passed, and now the time for anger is broken. The displeasure towards Zich was still there.

However, in the midst of that atmosphere, Zich persevered and did his job.

“It's still worth investigating the robes group. If Master Ma Thap doesn't do it, I'll go after them all by myself."

“… Please. Let me find out too.”

"Yes."

Zich answered without a smile on his face.

There were many people who made uncomfortable faces when it seemed that Matap Master was accepting Zich's opinion at a glance. However, it was also true that the lob group was worth investigating, so no one was outspoken against it.

“Oh, by the way. I heard earlier that the robes group had little to do with rescuing Elena, so I was going to put it off, but does anyone know who brought up that claim first?”

People were outraged by Zich's words. Are you still doubting yourself? However, the bitterness that permeated my heart made me stutter.

Some people could not remember exactly, but some recalled the situation at the time and turned their heads to the person who made the claim.

“What, what… .”

The main character who received attention is startled. Zich looked at him. And with a very unlucky smile, I called his name.

“Was it you? Wayne Jawick.”

(Continued on next page)

# No. 252 screen

Upon returning home, Wayne took off his robe and put his wand into a dedicated locker. The user who was waiting next to him quietly swallowed his saliva.

Wayne Jawick was on the dirty side. I usually have to be nervous when waiting for him, but Wayne was obviously in a bad mood right now.

In this case, if the pod is caught, it will not pass over.

“What’s going on with Marwin?”

Unfortunately, the most annoying question came to Wayne right now. So I can't refuse to answer. The user was prepared and answered.

“You are still locked up in your room.”

Wayne grinds his teeth gently. The user closed his eyes tightly.

But fortunately, what he was hoping for didn't happen. To his surprise, Wayne beckoned to the user. meant to go out.

How does it feel to escape from a hungry lion? He was delighted with this little luck and hurriedly left the room.

Wayne sat down on a chair. I remember the meeting we had today.

“Damn it!”

He picked up the ornaments from the table and threw them at the wall.

Koo!

It was made of wood, so it wasn't shattered, but it was clear that there must have been some gold. But he had no interest in the comfort of ornaments.

'That damn wanderer!'

It was the first time we met in person. But he wasn't much different from Wayne's imagination. rude and cocky

The street of swearing rose by just putting his face to face with the man who dared to make his son like that.

But he endured it with extreme patience.

'But you insult me!'

He argued first, but it didn't matter to Wayne.

Considering his status and authority, shouldn't he have to endure that much sarcasm? However, the other side insulted him in the opposite way.

My fists were clenched.

'Especially the last!'

Postponing comments on the robes group was treated as suspicious simply because he had made an opinion. That was the hottest thing.

Of course, no one really suspects him to be the culprit. The suspicious look was only for a moment.

Zich's words are only one of the possibilities, and the Jaewick family is a prestigious family.

But even that momentary doubt made him very displeased.

But there was another reason.

'You caught it!'

As Zich said, he intentionally took the topic off the robe group. But it was useless with one word from Zich. Now Wilwes Dwayne will follow in the footsteps of the Robes.

'I can't help it.'

Wayne pulled out a piece of paper, put it on the table, and picked up a pen.

The pen scratches the paper roughly. Black ink created regular letters. I couldn't find out It was not written in the world. It was a password. He took out a few more sheets of paper and wrote down the same code. I rolled up the paper and tied it with a string and got up from my chair.

The place he went to was the top of the mansion, where he raised Jeonseo-gu. After preparing as many pigeons as the number of letters, the letters were tied to the legs.

Get food!

Jeon Seo-gu flew up. They circled the sky a few times and then scattered in all directions.

'This must be it.'

Wayne stares at where the western districts roam

I saw. As the sun went down, the sky was as red as blood.

The search for Elena continued. They scoured the city or poked through the forest around the city. In the meantime, pitiful beasts and monsters were slaughtered.

However, Elena was still nowhere to be seen.

Zich was wandering the backstreets of the city today as well. The cause was, of course, to find Elena. I went around asking about Elena while beating the bad guys in the back alleys.

Of course they didn't know about Elena.

'Because Elena is in my hands.'

It is true that those who were victimized by Zich would roll their eyes in shame if they found out, but Zich did not feel any remorse.

'It's not a sin to bully bad guys.'

It was a really simple way of thinking.

“Hey heck!”

This time, of course, he threw the bastard, who could not give an answer, to the wall, and Zich went into another back alley.

Relieve your stress again... No, I was going to find a bad guy who might know Elena's information.

'.•Hmm'

Zich's eyes turned slightly to the side. But the action remained the same. Legs advanced forward, arms waved lightly, and face turned forward.

However, Zich's sense of the back was sensed.

'You've got a follow-up.'

There are only two people. Zich walked into the alley pretending not to know.

'Are they like assassins?'

The movement was never ordinary. They weren't even the ones who lived on a knife, and even less so were the wizards.

Clearly, they were the ones who had learned to hide and track their opponents professionally.

'Are they robes?'

But it wasn't that much of a skill move.

Zich headed to a more sparsely populated place. There were houses that looked like they were about to be demolished at any moment. It was an abandoned place where there was no sign of people living around it.

Zich searched the place as if looking for Elena.

'•••You're not coming out.'

Even though he moved to a place with few people to make an attack, there was no movement of the opponent. He just hid himself and stared at Zich.

'The raid is not the purpose.'

If so, what is the purpose?

Zich ended the search. As Zich moved, they moved too.

Zich went out to the downtown area this time. They still followed him.

'I followed by treading  itgun. "

If so, there is only one reason that comes to mind.

'Waiting for me to go to Elena.'

It was clear that Zich had been caught kidnapping Elena.

It's definitely a dangerous situation. But Jik smiled rather.

'I got it!'

Usually, Zich's method is to catch the things that secretly follow him and extract a lot of information, but this time he stopped.

Rather, they slowed down a bit in case they missed him.

They continued to follow him, even as he roamed the city all day. It continued until Zich entered the dormitory.

'You're not approaching the dormitory.'

It seemed that he had no intention of taking the risk to that extent.

Zich entered his room. The pursuers were still there. For a moment, one person disappeared, and then there seemed to be a sign of coming back.

'You've been swapped'

It means they are ready for a long battle. Zich left the dormitory once again.

Followers followed him. When Zich bought some fruit from the shop and returned to their dorms, they settled down again near the dormitory.

At that time, it was felt that the two popular characters were more established around the dormitory.

The movement was similar, and it was the same kind of bastards as the followers who followed Zich.

'They are attached to Lyla.'

As Zich guessed, a sign was coming into the room next to Zich. It was Lyla's room.

Zich opened the door and pulled his upper body out.

"It's a surprise!"

I saw Laila, startled, at the sudden opening of the door. When Zich laughed, he frowned lightly at the handsome ARMY.

"what's the matter?"

“I have something to tell you. come in."

The two sat facing each other in Zich's room with a table in the middle. Jack opened his mouth.

“We are under surveillance.”

“You said you were under surveillance?”

Lila narrowed her eyes. Zich nodded.

“You and I each got two. They're professionally trained, as their tailing skills are pretty good. Oh well, they're not that dangerous. If they attack you, you will be able to counterattack.”

“Of course, no matter how weak I am in close combat, I have no intention of being attacked by those who hide… .”

Still, the fact that there was a follow-up was unpleasant in itself.

“Who sent it?”

"I do not know. I have expectations.”

“Don’t turn around, tell me.”

“Black. Even if not, those who have anything to do with them.”

" The reason is?"

“I think you noticed that we kidnapped Elena.”

Lyla's eyes widened. She tilts her head.

"how? It wouldn't have flowed away from you, too, in this kind of audacity, and I acted quite cautiously, didn't I?"

“It’s shameless. You sound bad.”

“That is true.”

Despite Zich's booing, Lila did not cancel her words.

“Maybe Hans or Snock didn’t get caught?”

"no. If it were, I wouldn't have approached it so slyly. If you look at their behavior now, they are waiting for us to go to Elena.”

“Then how did you find out?”

“There is only one thing I can think of.”

Zich crossed his arms and relaxedly leaned against the backrest.

A mischievous smile on his face. Lyla felt the long tension slide down. Because I was familiar with that look.

“Are you saying this is also according to your plan?”

“Is that so?”

The soft voice sounded like a joker's line on stage. Lyla said, lightly patting Zich's shin with her toe.

“Don’t make fun of me, just tell me.”

“If Lady is like that, there is nothing I can do about it.”

Zich, who exaggeratedly greeted him, began to explain.

“Let’s go over it from the beginning. Don't you think Elena's kidnapping was very sudden?"

“Is it sudden?”

"okay. Did you know that I gave Hans and Snock a few orders before we were imprisoned?”

Lyla nodded her head.

“Honestly, the kidnapping of Elena was a bit of a lower priority. There are many other ways to distance the Dwayne and the Jaewick family apart. Even if everything is difficult, doing it a little later is more effective. As a final blow when the relationship between the Dwayne and the Jawicks got worse than they are now.”

“By the way, Elena’s abduction was unexpectedly quick, didn’t it?”

“It’s not just that. The robes went out on their own to kidnap Elena. Looking at the guys so far, they're the ones who prefer to move their agents thoroughly from behind. It was only when the incident had just reached his pants that he showed himself directly. But this time, I got into the heart of the city and did a high-risk job, kidnapping Elena.”

“Is it time to close the case already?”

“It didn’t happen too well for that. Think about the events they've committed so far. But now we have more than just beating Jack Jack Ma?”

Lyla pressed Zich's words with her eyes.

“This is my conclusion. That the guys have greatly advanced this plan. If you think about it that way, it makes sense that these guys took risks and moved directly. The plan went awry, so even if you move on your own, you have to get results.” If so, it is understandable that the cautious robes moved directly.

“Then why did the guys advance the plan? Because there are variables. It’s a variable that guys hate so much.”

“Is it because of our existence? Because we taught Elena magic?”

“It won’t be. There can always be situations where you want to teach her magic. As a young-ae from a prestigious family in the city where the tower is located, her grandfather is the owner of the tower, and her father is also a great wizard. There's no way you're going to have a plan that's ruined by learning magic."

"then?"

“But we did it in an unusual way.”

“… The magic of knowledge”

Suddenly, Lila's eyes widened.

“Come to think of it, you told Elena, who was imprisoned, that you can continue to study magic using the magical powers of Nowet! Could you think of something like this?”

Zich chuckled.

(Continued on next page)

“Now, let’s make a guess. Elena is definitely talented. It's also an amazing talent. But I haven't even developed my magical powers yet. There must be some external action. But the moment she used the power of Knowwet, the moment we found out that something was wrong with her body, it suddenly started happening.”

“And when Elena practiced magic using the magical powers of Nowem, you felt it and started monitoring us, didn’t you?”

“That’s it.”

“It would be fair to say that you can feel the magic power of Wet flowing through Elena’s body.”

“He’s the one who prevented Elena from using her magical powers until now. There is nothing strange about having such an ability.”

Lyla's body, which had folded her arms and nodded, stopped for a moment.

"for a moment. The fact that the dark curtain can identify us means that we know that we educated Elena with the power of Knowm... .”

“Does anyone come to mind too?”

Lyla's eyes deepened.

“••• Willwes Dwayne. And Orland Dwayne.”

There seems to be something wrong with Elena's body. If you solve it, Elena might be able to use magic.

Zich was the only two people who reported that fact. Being Elena's family, they had a right to know.

“Of course, it may not be the two of them. Since we were famous for teaching Elena, it's an area that can be deduced enough. But it is also true that the two are more suspicious.”

Lila sighed.

Watching Zich continue to doubt the two, I kept thinking that it would be nice if they weren't in darkness.

'It would be a big wound to Elena.'

I can't let that go. The person who made Elena unable to use magical powers. I can't believe he has good intentions.

“Now what?”

“I’m not going to do anything for a while.” Zich looked out the window. Then I glanced around where the followers were hiding.

“If I don’t go see Elena, there must be something moving.”

“By the way, what about the servants?”

Wayne asked at a meeting at Dwayne's mansion, which is now almost regular.

Zich looked at him.

“You mean my servants?”

"okay. I know you have two people you call servants. But it was hard to see them.”

"Hey. Now a little... .”

A colleague next to him stopped him, wondering if Wayne was arguing again. Frowning, he also seemed quite annoyed by Wayne's behavior.

But Wayne said calmly, not excited.

“It’s not arguing. No matter how much I am, I have not been arguing until now. This is questionable.”

« O ”

My colleague, who was drying it, gave me a slightly suspicious look, but stopped drying it. Wayne kept asking Zich questions.

“Did I say you and your colleague, Miss Lyla? Anyway, it seems that the two of you are searching the city very hard. But I can't see the faces of your servants. At least one seems to be pushing his face, but the other doesn't show his face at all.”

“You know it pretty well. Did you step on your back?”

“You’re following me. What kind of scary sound is that? I just did a little more careful research. didn't you tell me too There may be companions of robed corpses in this place.”

“It is.”

“Doesn’t that mean that there may be someone here who has kidnapped Miss Dwayne?”

people murmured

Zich looked at Wayne. Wayne continued speaking skillfully.

“If there is a possibility that there is a corpse here, that is, a comrade of the suspects who tried to kidnap Elena, I thought that there might be the person who kidnapped Elena or a colleague as well.”

“It is a very dramatic story, but it is not without possibility. But you know that it will come back to you as well, right?”

"of course. You can also investigate me at will. But before that, may I ask where your servants are and why they don't appear near you?”

Wayne's eyes twinkled like a viper that drives a rat into a corner.

“I don’t think so, but one of my subordinates is concerned. After you kidnapped Ms. Dwayne and locked her up somewhere, you had your servants to watch over you. Then I can understand the behavior of your servants. One watches over Miss Dwayne and the other takes charge of that liaison. Can't you see it that way?"

"i See. That makes a lot of sense.”

Wayne rolled his eyes.

He doesn't seem to like Zich's smirk.

“I'm glad you think so. Then can you tell me where your servant is and what he does?”

“They are searching outside the city. So I don't think it was found."

“Have you never been to the city?”

“As you know, we are travelers. Homelessness was devastating. Rather than spending time traveling to and from the city for nothing, I am cooking outside the castle and looking for Elena.” Zich took a teacup in front of him and took a leisurely sip of tea. Then he smiled at Wayne.

“Is there an answer?”

“Yes.”

Wayne also smiled.

“If what you say is true.”

“Unfortunately, there is no other way to claim my innocence.”

"Then can't you let me meet your servants?"

“If you want, I will.”

The two smiles met.

People swallowed their saliva at the strange pressure. However, to what extent Wayne's words worked, doubts remained in the eyes of those who looked at Zich.

In the first place, Zich is an outsider. If I had to believe either one of Zich or Wayne, everyone here would believe Wayne.

But Zich didn't care. He focused only on Wayne in front of him.

'I got it!'

“Wayne Jawick is suspicious?”

"okay."

When Zich returned to his dorm, he immediately told Lyla what had happened today.

“Even if I follow you, nothing comes out, so I’m pressing head on. My son seems to have something to do with the robes, so that's even more suspicious."

“Then is that person a black shroud?”

“That should be investigated. Maybe he's poking through Wayne Jawick, who has a lot of bad feelings for me.”

“Anyway, I'm pretty sure there's something suspicious about Wayne Jawick. What are you going to do?”

“I want you to be suspicious. Then you have to check.”

Zich pulled out an artifact. It's an invisibility artifact that I've benefited from quite a bit in the past.

Zich looked out the window. There, as it had been a while ago, a follower was settling down.

“My alibi will be proven by those guys.”

Zich gave a mischievous smile.


Zich was standing in front of a mansion. The mansion in front of him was huge enough, although it was not comparable to the mansion of Dwayne where Matapper lived.

It was Jake.

'I'm buying it in a noble place.'

Reminds me of Rich Jack's annoyed face.

'Would you like to break it up a bit when it comes out?'

But soon he shook his head.

'Do it later. Afterwards. You should definitely do it.'

Anyway, there is a high probability that the Jaewick family has something to do with the dark side.

'Then you can create a cause and destroy it. Thoroughly and surely.'

But now is the time to be patient. Zich lightly climbed over the fence. The guards did not find Zich.

Zich hid inside the mansion.

'It seems like they're only sneaking in these days.'

Before returning, I remember the days when I was coolly knocked down by force to block such a naughty thing without even looking at it.

went up and got a little frustrated.

'Ttt! Let's be patient.'

His magic is being successfully dissipated. I moved in earnest, reminding myself that the same future would come again soon.

Avoiding the users he encounters occasionally, he rummaged through the mansion.

There were a lot of rooms. Most of them were empty or guest rooms, and it didn't seem like there was anything important.

Then Zich found a room with a popular chuck. It didn't look like the user was sitting still in the room.

Zich went out the window through the next room and ran into the next window. There was no sound. He hung from the window and looked into the room.

'You're Marwin Jawick.'

He sat blankly on the bed. The blurred focus doesn't seem to have been properly embedded.

'You said that you were locked up in a room as a half-closet, was it like that?'

Zich returned to the building through the window of the next room.

I saw the figure of Jack Ma, but he was not impressed.

No anger, no sympathy. Already, the existence of Jack Ma had no meaning for him.

'Isn't there anything useful other than that useless thing?'

Zich began to search the mansion again.

It was when he reached the top floor. His sensitive hearing heard the small cry of the beast.

Zich quietly entered a room.

'This is the room that stores Jeonseo-gu.'

Jeon Seo-gu roars lightly and shakes their heads. Zich looked around the room.

'I can't see anything here.'

Animal stench and excrement from all over the world. And it is a place with only a feeder bowl and a bucket of water.

It didn't seem like there was any important information in the place for the westerners sitting on the perches hanging from the ceiling.

Get food!

At that time, a Jeon Seo-gu landed into the open space above the roof.

' Huh?'

Seeing the Jeon Seo-gu unconsciously, Zich's eyes lit up.

A piece of paper was hung from the bridge in Jeonseo-gu. Someone sent a letter to the mansion.

'Of course I should check?'

Zich released the invisibility. Jeon Seo-gu flapped their wings a little in surprise, but did not run away. It was the result of training.

Zich carefully pulled the letter out of Jeonseo-gu's bridge and unfolded it.

On a piece of paper the size of the palm of his hand, there were characters he had never seen before.

'It's a password.'

Zich took a piece of paper from the magic box and copied it. Then he rolled up the letter and carefully tied it back to Jeonseo-gu's bridge.

Jeonseo-gu, who had flapped its wings for a moment, became quiet again when Zich tied a paper to his leg and stepped back.

'For now, one harvest.'

I don't know what it is, but it could be an important clue. Zich quietly walked out of the Jeonseo-gu room.

The search for the mansion continued. But since then, nothing has been found of any significance.

I found a place that seemed to be Wayne's room and searched for any sort of secret room, but nothing was found.

'Are achievements end with one letter?'

It's better than nothing, but it's also disappointing.

That was the time when Zich was thinking about getting out of this mansion.

A story was heard.

'I think it's a drawing room.'

At night, it was already dusk, and complete darkness was covering it.

You are a guest until this time.

'Should I check?' You cannot open the door to the drawing room. Just like when breaking into Ma's room, he decided to break in through the window.

I went out to the window using the room next to the drawing room. The drawing room was on the second floor, so he hung from the window sill. And then lightly jumped sideways.

chin!

There was a small noise, but the conversation in the drawing room did not stop. It means you didn't hear it.

Zich tightened his arms and raised his head above the window.

The view of the drawing room caught my eye.

Wayne was having two guests. These were the people Zich knew.

'Wilwes Dwayne. And Orland De Wayne.'

They were the only ones talking to Wayne.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 254 screen

'It's an interesting combination.'

All of them are related to Zich. Wilwes and Orland were Elena's family and had a bad relationship with Wayne.

Zich listened carefully.

"So, I guess your story is Zich, he's suspicious."

"That's right."

'I said, 'Why are you gathering?'

Apparently, Wayne invited Willwes and Orland to curse Zich.

'Huh? Wayne Jawick didn't know Wilwes, but didn't he have a bad relationship with Orland?'

Zich's doubts were soon revealed.

“Did you just call your father to say that?”

“… Dwayne, I don't remember inviting you before."

“It is not unusual for a son to serve his father. Besides, I heard you're talking about Elena's work. Then I'm not a good party either."

Annoyance appeared on Wayne's face, but he didn't say any more. You could get Orland out of here, but that's never a good way to go.

'I was forcibly chasing you.'

With the current conversation, Zich clearly understood the situation.

“Anyway, I think so. What do you think of Ma Thapju?”

Wayne seemed to ignore Orland and force the conversation. But Orland didn't seem to have come all the way here to stay still.

“Surely, evidence is  not the leap I mentioned earlier .”

“It’s an elixir! I'm not sure it's suspicious!"

Orland chuckled.

“With that said, none of those present were unsuspecting! It's not funny to mobilize a few people all in secret. You say we can all do it!”

'Well! Well!'

Zich nodded at the window. If I could, I wanted to applaud Orland.

'Of course I'm the one who kidnapped Elena.'

"It's more convincing that you forced this to happen because of your grudge against Mr. Zich!"

"what… !”

Like a dirty-tempered Wayne, he tried to shout out loud. However, he was usually excited and should have run rampant on the road, but this time, somehow, he looked like he was suppressing his anger.

'what? Are you surprised?'

Jack was quite surprised. Like Orland, he was making a sullen expression on his face. It seems that Wayne was meant to raise his voice when he made a loud noise.

“Honestly, I hate him. not admit it But it is also true that his servant is acting suspiciously. I once followed a servant whose face was revealed once in a while, but I missed him every time.”

“Does that alone make you suspicious of him?”

“An unknown wanderer. And they even became friends in the name of teaching Elena. do you know that Surprisingly, kidnappings happen frequently even among people you know.

“That alone cannot be doubted.”

“Well, it is not.”

Orland's eyes widened as Wayne affirmed.

“Anyway, I am definitely suspicious of the author. And I'll check it myself when I summon his servants this time. Whether it’s digging them up or giving them a better follow-up.”

There was a firm conviction in Wayne's voice. Zich was also convinced.

'That guy, I know we kidnapped Elena.'

Just hearing that was enough achievement.

“What do you think, Master Ma Thap?”

Wayne asked Willwess. It was clear that he wanted Nuances to agree with him.

'No, it's a little more bizarre than that, isn't it?'

That attitude gave me a stronger feeling of thinking about the other person's heart than wanting to agree.

'Does Wayne Jawick think Wilwes Dwayne thinks like him?' It was when Zich pushed his head a little further into the room to hear the conversation in detail.

7  、Uh

— — । •

Wilwes turned his head. His eyes looked out the window.

'What is it?'

Zich looked back. But there was nothing outside the window. He looked back into the room. Wilwes' eyes continued to look out the window.

'•••no.'

A cold sweat formed on Zich's back.

'That's not looking out the window.'

Push your feet against the wall and jump back. Zich's body moved away from the window. Wilwes's eyes moved slightly.

'You're looking at me!'

Aww!

In an instant, the entire window from which Zich had been hanging was burned and a pillar of fire was shot. The pillar of fire that passed right in front of his face burned his whole body.

fault!

Zich put his feet on the ground. And it moved quickly.

'Spatter.'

We got information and this is also the enemy's home ground. And above all else… .

'Wilwes Dwayne. It's not something I can beat right now.'

Before he could finish thinking, Zich turned around.

Aww!

A fireball fell down where he was. A huge pit was dug black.

'Shit! That's damn fast!' Still, the wall is right in front. If you go into the city like this, even Wilwes will not be able to attack properly.

But his intentions were blocked.

Whoops!

burning wall. It was like the fear of the devil that divides the world from hell. A wall five times taller than a human was blocking Sam Sot Zich's escape route in front of the fence.

"•••Damn it."

Here, Zich had no choice but to bite his tongue. Even if you don't come close, you can feel the great heat.

The surrounding grass and trees were burning with fuzzy smoke, even though they did not even touch the wall of fire.

Zich picked up a branch at his feet and threw it at the wall of fire.

Whoops!

Branches that had caught fire before reaching the wall were scattered as new black remnants as soon as they entered the wall of fire.

'It will be difficult to break through with a determination to fight.'

I thought about jumping up, but the moment I try to do it, the attack will come from behind.

'That would be difficult to stop.'

Zich let out a low sigh. Then he  turned and raised his head.

Now is the time for the pitch black darkness to spread. It was cloudy today, so the moon and stars did not rise. But now, the neighborhood of Zich was bright as if it were broad daylight.

The air a little further away from Zich. There were dozens of huge fireballs floating around.

It wasn't just a fireball either. Each one was two or three times the size of a human.

It was as if dozens of suns appeared in the sky.

and its center. Like the incarnation of a god with the sun, he was floating in the air.

“Honestly, I was confused.”

That, Wilwess said.

“It seemed to have a glimmer of magical energy, but I didn’t feel like it was just this. But I guess the rat must have been hiding there.”

'It's a magical energy. Did you get caught by the door during the Artifact? The magical energy would have been concealed as much as possible.'

Truly the owner of the tower. Should I say that he is said to be the best wizard of the current generation?

The invisibility artifact, which has supported Zeek's infiltration so far, will hold his ankles.

“Unleash that kind of magic. It doesn’t work for me anymore anyway.”

Zich meekly dispelled the magic. Since Will Weiss began to capture himself with his magical energy, the invisibility magic only made the situation worse.

He just covered his face with a robe. He had no intention of revealing his identity to Wilwess now.

When Zich wearing a robe was revealed, Wilwes gave a cold command.

“Take off your hood.”

“I hate that.”

Change your voice. Wilwes's face grew even colder.

“It would be better to just obey what you say. Unless you want to be ashes.”

“I will decline both. I won't take off my hood, and I won't turn to ashes. By the way, I won't reveal my identity, and I won't be caught."

Wilwes was stunned. He is a man who has had all sorts of experiences. I've been through a lot of battles and I've had assassination attempts.

But no one had ever said this in front of him. There were some humans who were pretentious, but as much as their body and voice were honest.

But now, the unknown man in front of him was so full of confidence that he was really rude.

“•••Well, that’s good. I will check your face after you burn your limbs.” Unlike his magic, Wilwes's voice seemed to freeze the surroundings with cold at any moment.

“But before that, let me ask you one thing. Are you, the guy related to Elena's kidnapping?"

Zich shrugged.

"I do not know."

"okay."

Wilwes raised his wand.

“Then don’t put off the serious question. But I beg you, don't die. Oh, I want to listen to the fucking week  because many. "

The fireballs around Wilwes began to move.

Zich also took out Windur. It was after Windur had already changed its form into an ordinary greatsword.

hooo

The fireballs came crashing down.

“Twitch!”

Zich pushed Windur upright. Even though the fireballs hadn't even approached them properly, their whole body was burning.

'I'm afraid someone isn't Elena's grandfather, so the technique is similar!' Like a divine judgment falling from the sky on an arrogant man, fireballs began to fall indiscriminately from the top of Zich.

Quang! Quang! Quang! Quang!

The yard of Jawick's mansion was literally starting to go to waste. The fireballs that fell to the ground burned the ground, creating a crater with a huge explosion.

But it didn't end there. It caused a huge explosion, but the fireballs did not disappear.

Like the sun stuck in the ground, he moved along with Zich, burning everything around him.

"Damn it!"

Zich loaded his sword with plenty of magic. Windur's power strengthened Zich's magical power.

“Ha ha ha!”

I don't see her usually relaxed at all now. As Zich swung Windur with plenty of energy throughout his body, a magical blade was fired.

Quad Duck!

The blade of magical power that Zich fired was stuck in the fireball that came first. Normally, Zich's attack would have cut the fireball lightly.

But not this time.

Whoops!

It was Zich's attack that was smashed. The magic blade could not penetrate the temperature and pressure of the fireball.

“••• Cry!”

Even Zich couldn't help but bite his tongue here. But as if it didn't matter what Zich was thinking, the fireball ignorantly pushed towards him.

“Breathe!”

Zich took a deep breath.

all. He stepped on the ground hard and concentrated his magic on the sword once again.

Suddenly, the fireball came close to Zich.

“Wow!”

My whole body was hot. The robe catches fire and the body burns. However, Zich was able to put his energy into important areas and survived. I couldn't defend my whole body. If so, it is pierced

“Ha ha ha!”

Zich stabbed the fireball with Windur.

Whoops!

There was a great sense of repulsion, but in the end, Zich was able to stab his sword into a single fireball. As it was, the magic was blown out of the sword.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

The current explosion seemed to be a joke, and an explosion struck the surroundings.

(Continued on next page)

“Cuckoo!”

Seeing barely escaped the explosion's range was disastrous. The whole body is red and hot and the oozes out.

The charred place crumbled and even the bones were exposed. But even the bones that were supposed to be white were burnt to black.

'I'm going to die.'

Zich quickly drank the potion. The pain was gone. As expected, the potion at the top of the Carwiman table had a different weakness.

'Ah, I suddenly miss Rubella so much.'

If she were there, even a wound of this size would be healed in no time.

Wilwes' attack was so terrifying that he misses Rubella, who is usually treated as a zombie maker.

'For now, Lyla can't be compared.'

Of course, after some time has passed, Lyla will be able to catch up. But now, whoever sees it, Wilwes is at the top.

But it didn't last long for Zich to think of such a semi-escape.

Whoo!

The fireballs aimed at Zich again. Zich quickly took out a new robe and covered himself. The robe he was wearing, as well as his clothes, were all in a handful of ashes.

It was only a matter of protecting the magic box. Fortunately, the dust from the explosion obscured the view, so Zich's face was not exposed.

quaang

The fireball was locked back in the place where Zich was.

'A head-to-head match should be avoided.'

Just breaking a single fireball could have cost her life. It was foolish to choose a head-to-head match here again.

Zich diddge the fireballs coming from behind again. But there was no way to avoid it. The speed of the fireball is also fast, and the number is not just one or two.

Whoops!

Zich took out a few daggers and threw them at Willwes in the air. However, the remaining fireballs around Wilwes moved and blocked Willus's in front.

Whoops!

I could see the daggers blocked by the fireball melting rapidly.

'It's the magic of the entire workshop. A clumsy attack won't even scratch it.'

Things got a little darker. However, the full-scale attack had not even begun yet.

"wool! Cro! God! Win! big! Wow!”

Wilwes started singing.

'Are you going to add more magic to this? That's too much, really!'

I had hopes that the movement of the fireballs would stop or at least slow down during the chanting, but it was a futile hope.

The fireballs still moved swiftly and attacked Zich.

▲ Ouch! - Ouch! ▲ Ouch! 'Huh!

New fireballs are created in the air. Their size was very small compared to the fireballs that were attacking Zich in real time. It was only the size of an adult fist.

But I couldn't be reassured. Instead of being small in size, those small fireballs boasted a huge number. It was literally believed that the sky had turned red.

'Oh, please. Say it's not what I think it is.'

However, at least after the start of this battle, the existence of hope had completely turned away from Zich.

Whoo!

With the movement of Wilwes's staff, the small fireballs that colored the sky began to hit the ground all at once.

It would be a very beautiful sight from afar. It may look like a meteor that draws beautiful lines in the sky, or like a giant firefly descending to the ground.

But for Zich, the sight was a damn sight, even after hours of swearing.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

The crashes and explosions were really non-stop. Red flashes of red flashed from the ground like short-lived red flowers blooming and disappearing countless times.

The gardens of the Jaewick mansion have already been devastated to such an extent that it cannot be called a garden if only common sense can judge.

not even ruins. The land melted and even a small lake of magma was created.

quaang

The last fireball fell and the magic was over.

“Do you think you are alive?”

Wayne, who was watching a magic show through the hole Wilwes had drilled in the mansion, asked in a trembling voice.

No matter how much he thought about it, it was unlikely that an unidentified intruder would survive under that formidable magic.

“I wish I did.”

It was no different for Orland. His eyes stayed in the scorched garden and then looked at his father, still in the air.

Wilwes was the one who usually had the consciousness of being the owner of the tower and coordinated the schools as mildly as possible.

He and Orland often clashed with Elena over Elena's education.

Because of this, people may have become more comfortable with Wilwes and made happy with his bad words. I know in my head that he is a great wizard, but I haven't seen him perform his skills in person for quite some time.

However, seeing the scene in front of them, they had no choice but to realize what kind of being Wilwes was.

Master of Snoowick Tower. The most powerful magician of the tower. The strongest magician in the flame world, who was even called 'the devil's agent that descends from hell' in the past.

The power of a wizard called Wilwes Dwayne.

But regardless of the thoughts of the two people behind him, Will Weiss quietly looked at the horrific scene he had created. His eyes look for the enemy.

Whoops!

The ground exploded. Smoke billows were scattered all over the place. Zich crawled out of a hole that had been drilled quite deep.

“ I thought  I was going to die !”

That was the sincerity of Zich, without a single joke.

“•••Amazing.”

Wilwess said in a tone of admiration.

“I guessed that he would be barely alive at this level, but I think he might be able to move.”

“I was almost on the verge of dying, you fucking idiot!”

I really felt like I should give Carwiman plenty of gifts of thanks.

“So what did I say? I never thought it would be possible. I guess you should have been on fire, literally holding your breath.”

He couldn't find the image of the grandfather Zich knew, worried about Elena's future and agonizing over it. That was Willus Dwayne as a mage dealing with enemies.

“But now that you survived the attack, I must use a slightly more powerful magic.”

Again, magic power gathers in Wilwes' staff.

“This magic is a magic that I have recently created. In a way, you can call it experimental magic. But at least it will be more powerful than the magic you just used.”

“Didn’t I say that I would crush my limbs and vomit information to make me?”

“I know because we fight. I mean, you're quite a talented guy. It's a magic that I've been working hard on, but it's still unfinished. You might be able to stand it.”

The magical energy that Wilwes emitted literally swept the surroundings.

“Thank you for granting me a request not to die. So please don’t ask me one more time.”

Cuckoo Cuckoo!

The ground shakes.

Whoa whoa!

The Wind Blows. and.

Whoops!

The flame burns.

“Don’t die again this time.”

With those words, Wilwes began to memorize the young chant again.

A very fast pace that never beats Lyla's chanting speed. He bit his tongue a few times, but his pronunciation was useless.

The anomaly around it became stronger. The flames grew bigger, the winds grew stronger, and the earth shook more and more.

'It's a three-property fusion magic.'

really do everything The problem was that it was a serious threat to Zich.

'what? But where do you think you saw this magic?'

There is no time for leisurely contemplation. It is easy to see that the magic that will fly from now on is not ordinary magic just by the tingling of the surrounding magic. But the corner of his head kept tickling.

'Where did you see the magic?'

Wilwes said that it was a magic he developed himself. A wizard, even a magician in charge of the mage, wouldn't lie about magic.

So, if Zich knew this magic, he probably knew it before the return.

'But I've never met Willus Dwayne before returning.'

When Zich started to fight Matop in earnest, Orland Dwayne was in charge of the matop.

'Did Orland use his father's magic?'

However, as Zich knew, the magic of Matapju at the time was a type of ice magic. It also coincided with Elena's words.

'Then what  ... .' But there was no more time to think. After the chanting of Willwes was over, the magic unfolded in earnest.

Up until now, Zich had compared Wilwes's magic to the flames of Hell. But it wasn't.

Compared to the magic unfolding before his eyes, the magic that Wilwes has unfolded so far is not even on the axis of hell.

fireworks dance The flames engulfed by the intense heat moved passionately, as if it would turn everything it touched to ashes.

The wind helps the flame. The wind holding hands with the flame spread the flame and heat to all directions, creating a huge flame of vortex.

There the earth intervened. Soil and rocks rise up and blow like crazy, leaving me to the wind and mixing with the flames.

The scale of the magic is too large for a movement to defeat at least one human. Even if it was used against any group of troops, it would be ridiculously wiped out.

'It's like a jingling inspiration!' But the feeling of seeing this magic never leaves. The union of fire and wind and earth. It's a sight that really spreads out hell.

'•••hell?'

In an instant, a flash of light flashed in Zich's mind.

'Inferno!'

This is the magic name. As the name came to mind, other memories came to mind in a chain.

When he saw this magic, how powerful it was, and who used it.

'haha! Could it be that he was the inspiration?'

Jack laughed. In a place like this, I hope to meet the relationship before the return. Zich looked at Willus floating in the air.

'Now that I look at it, it seems that they have something in common.'

The person Zich knew was a skinny and poor-looking guy that would not be an exaggeration to say that he had only flesh attached to his bones. But before the return, no one ignored that person.

Because he was such a strong human being that he could literally use the expression “absolute” as much as the firepower exploding from his skinny body.

'The Demon King of Magic!'

A person who reached the peak of the Age of Magic like Zich. When it comes to magic, even Elena Dwayne, who was a member of the Dragon's Party, couldn't come close. That is the Demon King of Magic.

'for a moment! But the Demon King of Mage and Elena or Dwayne had a grandson relationship/?'

This is information that will surprise Zich as well.

'Obviously, I heard that the Demon King of Magic was killed by Gren Jennerd and his companions.' And certainly among those companions was Elena Dwayne.

'You mean you killed your grandfather.'

But Zich thought it might be soon.

Before the return, the demon king of magic was one of those who received the title of demon king like Zich. Its behavior was so bad that it was comparable to that of Zich.

'Well, as Elena at the time, there must have been no help.'

And that's the story before the return.

'If Wilwes Dwayne is the Demon Lord of Magic, then we should exclude him from the list of suspects for cooperation with the Robes. Rather, that inspiration must have been the target of the robes.'

I plan to trample on all the plans of the robes, so there will be no tragedy in which Wilwes will fall into a demon and become the Demon Lord of Magic, and Elena fights with his grandfather.

'She is a disciple that Laila loves, so she should do that.'

But it also has to survive here.

'Other magic would have been more troublesome, but I'm glad it's Inferno.' Zich had been subjected to the perfect form of this magic before. Because of that, I desperately know about its power.

'And also weaknesses.'

Zich fixed his sword and clenched it.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 256 screen

The relationship between Zich and the Demon Lord of Magic was not a good one, even if it was wrapped up in any kind words.

In the first place, the creators of the Demon King are the highest among demons who are the ultimate kings of Lee Ki-joo's righteousness. It would be even more bizarre to say that they are good friends.

Of course, Zich bumped into other demon lords a lot. There were times when I was alone, and there were times when I really led all the forces and rushed to kill the opponent with all-out warfare.

The reasons were varied. Sometimes it was because of the pride between the powers, there were times when the interests overlapped, and there were times when the other person was simply ignorant and did not like the other person.

A daily life where people risk their lives to fight even for reasons that a third person would think of as 'only'. That was the era of Majin that Zich lived before returning.

Aww!

A huge flame crushes the earth. It burned everything within its range to ashes, and those outside its range set themselves on fire at high temperatures.

Quang! Quang! Aww!

It was a flame that boasted tremendous power with just one, but strangely, there were not one or two of them.

Literally, it was pouring down over the sky, and it looked like the wrath of a god or an invasion of the devil.

Whether the target was an animal, a plant, or an object, it seemed that it could never leave its shape in the face of the attack.

However, one human, the target of magic, moved with a lot of leeway in the midst of the great attacks.

Whoops!

A ball of fire is cut by his sword and explodes. It was a fireball that could not resist any attack due to the high temperature and pressure, but lost its shape in vain to the current sword attack.

He, who broke a fireball, clenched the sword with both hands. His proud sword, Tornium, blew out a calm sword name.

Jack moved.

Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

It's so fast that you can't even see an afterimage

The tornium wielded by crabs vomited sharp swords.

Dozens or hundreds of swordsmen show their teeth and run towards the sky. They met the flames.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Red flowers bloomed in the sky. Remnants of a beautiful and colorful but terrifying and cruel flame fell from the sky.

He knocks out the sparks that fall on him and tramples them as if showing off the flames that have fallen on the ground nearby. And he looked up at the sky.

All the flames that had colored the sky red had disappeared. Instead, a man was now floating in the air against a sky covered in black smoke.

A dark robe and a staff with bright red jewels attached at regular intervals that shakes the mind at a glance.

Both were full of personality that could grab people's attention in an instant, but it was the owner's appearance that caught the eye the most.

white hair and beard. However, they were only recognizable as they were placed on a person's face, giving off images of half-rotted spider webs rather than human hair.

Wrinkled wrinkles and puffy eyes. Cheek flesh is stuck to the bone as if it didn't exist since birth. The finger holding the cane looks like a mummy.

Overall, it looked like a human bone was roughly covered with leather.

If you show it to a child, it will make you cry wonderfully. Zich also hated his appearance very much.

"Inspiration! Didn't I tell you to keep your face fat at least until I see you next time? Last time I brought you meat as a gift. How long are you going to live like that?”

The eyes of the demon king of magic, who Zich called inspiration, twitched in displeasure. He lost his red color and moved his chapped lips. An unpleasant voice rang out.

“You mean rotting orc meat soaked in Hydra’s poison? I can't understand your filthy personality when you offer something like that as a gift!"

“No matter how old you are, you are still fighting for side dishes. Looking at the face of the inspiration, it's obvious that he can't live without even that kind of stuff, but what? And conscientiously, let's not talk about our humanity. It’s the same whether you or I have our personality destroyed.”

“At least better than you!”

"Hahaha! One of the best jokes I've ever heard, inspiration. I didn't see it like that, are you kidding me?"

“I guess you just want to think that your nigga is a joke. It is true that no matter how rotten I am, I have a better personality than yours. Even if you grab hold of the humans in the neighboring countries and ask them, they will all say the same thing!”

“The illusion is enough to make me feel sympathetic. You've already got dementia, inspiration? Everyone in the world knows that my personality is better than yours!”

“Dementia must be yours! The little guy already. And that my humanity is better, not only all humans, but also the elves in that Adrowon Great Forest!”

“Then I acknowledge the dwarves too!”

“All the different races in the world think I’m better!”

“Even a dragon that disappeared from the world will think I’m better!”

It's childish for a fight between two demon kings, the object of fear and fear around the world. But even if anyone had seen it, they would never have laughed at it.

Contrary to the childish accusations that come out of their mouths, the destruction they create was truly abhorrent.

Aww!

The flames created by the Demon King of Magic created a huge crater. A small pool of magma formed in the center of the crater.

Quad Duck!

The sword strike that Zich fired made a small canyon on the floor. The rough torn shape is as if a giant giant forcibly ripped a gap in the ground.

“You bastard! The form of running away with a roar doesn't match your tinnitus at all! How the hell did that guy get the title of the Demon King of Power!”

“I didn’t even say a word to put it like that! What's the law that tells me to take responsibility for what other people call me? Above all else, things like you and me are as good as crumbs that fell while eating bread. Aren't you too out of shape to swear with something like that?"

“There’s no such thing as pride in the name of the Demon King!”

“I’ll swing my sword one more time while I’m growing something like that!”

Aww!

The two attacks collided once again. The sword and flame dance in the air, devastating the surroundings.

"And who's just running away, you fucking bastard!"

woo woo woo!

Zich swung his sword. A huge slash that flies. At the same time, he stretched out his hand and poured out his magical power.

“Wow!”

The demon lord of magic comforted his body for a moment. The slash could have been avoided with ease, but the magical energy that Zich radiated passed right under his feet.

Moreover, the magic power tried to entangle his legs like a snake, as if it had a will of its own.

The Demon King of Magic hurriedly lifted his body more and escaped the crisis.

'You're in trouble'!'

The demon king of magic looked at Zich. Since most of them use swords, there are many people who have the perception that Zich only uses swords, but the reason why Zich was really afraid was not because of his swordsmanship.

'An absurd amount of magical power. And the control that can handle that magic power perfectly.

It's hard to deal with just one, but he has both. Moreover, the two are elements that perfectly complement each other and create synergy.

'Others are far above average.'

Swordsmanship, martial arts, combat sense and so on. Earlier, he argued that the Demon King of Power was incorrectly named, but he acknowledged that Zich was more worthy of the title of Demon Lord of Power than anyone else.

'But that's all.'

No matter how much Zich is called the Demon King of Power and is a person who is evaluated as the strongest among Demon Lords, he also received the title of Demon King.

The demon king of magic begins to sing a chant. The earth shook, the wind blew, and sparks blew.

'What's this.'

Seeing the rampant ground, Zich frowned. The wind roaring around and the flames rising from the surroundings seemed unusual.

“Look if you have something ready!”

Zich asked in a loud voice, but the Demon King of Magic did not care and sang only the chant.

Something tough is coming. Intuition, Zich also shut his mouth and looked around. Already surrounded by fire, wind and rocks.

He hurriedly fired a few sword strikes, but they were blocked in front of the Demon King of Magic.

“Die, Siegmore!”

The magic of the Demon King of Sorcery has been activated.

Fire and wind and stones fly. Things that can easily kill a person with just one come together to rush to Zich. Even for experienced Zich, this kind of magic was hard to see.

'Three-attribute fusion.'

Zich clicked his tongue. Should I really call him the Demon King of Magic?

Wizards who use three attributes in the first place are counted in the hand. And even those wizards mostly specialize in one attribute, and the other two attributes are only secondary.

Of course, the magic that even the Demon King of Mage used mainly was fire magic. However, he only enjoys using fire magic to the end, and he was not inexperienced in using magic of other attributes.

However, even if you can use all three attributes of magic skillfully, creating fusion magic is a different story.

This is because the problem of compatibility between attributes came first, and even if it was not compatibility, the balance between attributes had to be well balanced.

So was the magic in front of me. If the wind is strong, the flame will be swept away by the wind.

If the flame is strong, the stone will melt and the wind will break through the updraft of the flame.

If the stones are strong, the wind will not be able to blow them properly, and their power will die.

You must find the exquisiteness in which their strengths are highest and their weaknesses are lowest.

In other words, if you find the lowest weakness, it is surprisingly easy to break this magic.

Especially if you are proud of powerful magic power like Zich and excellent magic control.

'But not?'

He has good eyesight, has a good eye, and has a high sense of magic, but he couldn't find a place where this magic was inconsistent.

“Are you looking for magical vulnerabilities?”

The voice of the demon king of magic was heard. I can hear it very well even in a strong wind, so it looks like it used magical power.

“There is nothing like that! How much time and effort I spent to make this guy, do you think we'll see what it is! At first, the strength of the wind was weak, so the balance with the earth attribute was out of balance, but that has been resolved for a long time!”

'Anyway, even that inspiration likes to talk.'

Zich grunted inwardly, fixed his sword and grabbed it.

The magic of the demon king of mages is tightening. But Zich's eyes looking at it were calm.

'Clearly there is no weakness in sight.'

I admit that. The magic of the Demon King of Mage was very complete.

'But that's all.'

A tremendous amount of magical power erupted from Zich's body. Magic power is gathered in the tornium. Zich stared at the magic in front of him.

'If you can't see any weakness, just hit it with force and that's it!'

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Zich's sword strike spit out a tremendous amount of magical power. A powerful force that makes the sky rumble and the earth is extinguished. In front of that power, the magic of the Demon King of Mage disappeared.

* * *

'Yes, it was just this expression.'

When he broke the Inferno because he wasn't quite confident in his magic, Zich looked at Wilwess, recalling the astonished expression of the Demon King of Sorcery.

I see his horrified face. The expression of the Demon King of Mage you had seen before was superimposed on that of Willus.

“Uh, how… .”

Willwes looked at Zich, who had found the magic weakness and nullified it, with an unbelievable look. But Siek didn't answer the question and jumped right over the fence.

“Stand there!”

Someone shouted from afar.

'This is Orland Dwayne.'

Soon, something livable came to me from behind. It was a fairly sharp blow, but it wasn't too threatening for Zich, who had dealt with Wilwes so far.

chin!

Zich grabbed it with his bare hands without avoiding it.

'Ice awl.'

Orland's attack. After that, several more magical attacks flew. It was an attack from Orland and Wayne.

Wilwes soon came to his senses and cast his magic.

But avoiding them all, Sieg slowly disappeared into the darkness of the city.

All that was left was the yard of the three men with disappointing expressions and the completely devastated Ash Weeks.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 257 screen

“Father, are you okay?”

An urgent sound is heard from below. Will Weiss looked down to see his son Orland looking up at him.

Wilwess again cast his gaze toward the city center in the darkness where the unidentified man had disappeared.

" Okay."

His body began to descend slowly.

Kwajik!

As I landed on the ground, a feeling of something breaking came up under my feet. The white grains of ice that covered the ground were trampled and crushed.

The yard of the Jaewick family was frozen solidly in the meantime. Wherever the hellish sights covered with flames, magma, and ashes until now, the thinly frozen ground is spewing cold air.

Orland's work. Apparently, it was impossible to leave the terrain where the fire continued to burn and the magma flowed.

Wilwes looked at Orland. His expression seemed a little pale. Will Weiss distorted his expression slightly.

'It's just that the complexion has changed so much.'

Although it is a large-scale magic, Orland is the representative of a school and is one of the top ten wizards in the tower.

But soon I remembered Orland saying he wasn't in a good shape for the fort, and he pressed his chin down.

'You're overdoing it because of your daughter's work.'

Above all, I don't even have the right to rebuke him now.

“I missed it. You have no face.”

After bitterly telling his son, Will Weiss apologized to Wayne as well.

"You messed up the Jawick's yard. I will definitely reward you. I'm not sorry."

“Oh, no! Rather, an unidentified human has invaded our house, so our management is negligent. I have to apologize.”

Wayne was a bit harsh on Wilwes due to recent events, if not as much as Orland, but he was as gracious as he is now. He was afraid of the pile of ruins in front of him to put the flagpole on.

“Thank you for understanding.”

Wilwes thanked him.

“What kind of guy were you?”

Orland asked, looking at where Zich had escaped.

“I don’t know. But there is no doubt that he is a guy with unusual skills.”

'Even though it's incomplete, you see through my magic's weakness and break it down.' I was really surprised when he ripped the magic away, aiming at a place where the flow of magic was awkward. I've never been so surprised since I became a mato.

'I also used invisibility magic there.'

It wasn't the magician's movements, so maybe it was like using artifacts.

“Is he the one involved in Elena’s kidnapping?”

“The  possibility cannot be ruled out.”

That was the reason why I used my hands excessively in someone else's house in the first place.

“If that’s the case, then this case would be even more painful.”

Is there such a talented person on the other side? Wilwes' heart grew heavy.

* * *

When Zich returned, Lila was waiting for him in Zich's room. Seeing Zich, Lyla was very relieved.

“Are you worried?”

"of course!"

As if Zich's casual attitude was sarcastic, Laila replied a little harshly.

“Because there was a sudden commotion after you entered Jawick Street!”

“What, did you doubt my abilities?”

“I don’t even do it normally! But the magical power I felt there was beyond my imagination!”

'Well, if it was Lyla, I would have felt more sensitive.'

As he is an excellent mage, he must have felt the powerful magical power felt in the mansion stronger than anyone else.

“Don’t worry. Everything was healed from the injuries, and his identity was not revealed.”

"better? Are you hurt?”

“ I thought  I was going to die .”

and then laugh But Lila couldn't laugh. If Zich spoke like that, the intensity of the battle would have been beyond imagination.

“What the hell happened?”

“Before that, would you mind avoiding your seat for a moment?”

Zich lowered his robe slightly. His bare skin looked the same.

“My clothes were all burnt when I was attacked. All I'm wearing right now is this robe, so I want to wear some clothes. Of course, if you'd like to see me change, I'd be happy to take off a layer of mine... .” bang!

Before Zich could finish speaking, Lyla roughly shut the door and left. Jig looked at the door and smiled.

* * *

“There was Willus Dwayne.”

It was the first thing Zich said to Laila, who sat down next to her after taking her clothes off and putting them on.

“Wilwes Dwayne? mage master? Elena's grandfather?"

"okay."

“Are you caught by that person?”

Jack nodded his head.

“He was having a baby with Wayne Jawick with Orland Dwayne. I was hanging on the window sill and eavesdropping on something... .”

“You caught it.”

“It seems to have an artifact of invisibility magic. I was distracted. With a wizard of that level, no matter how much artifacts, the magic should have been done carefully.”

“Because of artifacts?”

“There is no need to feel guilty. To the extent that I fell asleep, I did it by my own judgment. It was me who underestimated the situation and also made the mistake of using artifacts in front of Snoowick's mage.”

After speaking calmly, Zich smiled meaningfully.

“Besides, we were able to get a good harvest thanks to that.”

"harvesting?"

Lyla asked, who was about to die for a moment, thinking that Zich was in danger because of her. It seems that the comfort, not the comfort of Zich, was effective.

“Do you know how many more demon lords there will be in the future besides me?”

"Huh. Both help the world one also not a ... No, I remember that they were all negative guys.”

Lyla's words were poignant, as it seems that the only thing to feel guilty about for Zich is to have, and evaluation is evaluation. Zich didn't deny it either.

"right. Among them, I found the Demon King of Magic.”

“The Demon King of Magic?”

Lyla was interested. Since he is a wizard himself, he had no choice but to be more interested in those who use magic professionally among demon lords.

"for a moment! Will Willwes Dwayne be the Demon King of Magic?”

It is an answer that can be reached easily without thinking deeply, considering the information gathered so far. After a moment's surprise, Laila convinced herself.

“Ha, indeed. Both of them are magic experts. There's nothing strange about the fact that the Demon Lord of Mage's past was the master of Snoo Week Magic Tower."

Then, as if wanting an answer to her guess, Lyla looked at Zich.

“You are right. Wilwes Dwayne is the person who becomes the Demon King of Magic.”

"Are you sure?"

“I have confirmed the original magic of the Demon Lord of Magic. He is definitely the Demon King of Magic.”

"I see."

When Zich spoke confidently, Lyla was also convinced.

“I thought he was a good-natured grandfather who cares about his granddaughter, but Dani later became a demon king.”

Then she was surprised again.

"for a moment! All demon lords were killed by Gren Jennerd and his companions! then… !”

“Helena killed her grandfather.”

“Did future Elena know?”

"I do not know. However, the Demon Lord of Mage must have known. Elena Dwayne's origins are quite famous."

A granddaughter who kills her grandfather. Just imagining it is a terrible relationship.

I don't know what events and circumstances in the future drove them like that, but at least Lyla didn't want her disciple Elena to have that experience.

“Are you going to change it?”

"of course."

Zich laughed cynically.

“Even though he was called the Demon King, he was also one of the demons. And now the robes have been found in this city.”

“They were trying to corrupt Wilwes.”

“It’s obvious. I only thought Elena was the target, but I didn’t know that the Demon King would come out of here.”

“Are they both targets?”

“It  could be.”

“Then we must quickly find allies of the robes. They must have had a local partner.”

"I found it. maybe."

"I found it?"

Lyla asked surprised.

“At least the one who targets Elena.”

Then Zich got up from his chair and moved to one wall. Lyla's eyes followed his movements slowly. Zich picked up something that was leaning against the wall.

"•••ice?"

Lyla murmured its identity.

"right."

Zich put it on the table.

It was an ice pick the size of a human forearm. It had a rough surface as if it had been rough cut with a knife, but only the tip of the awl was very sharp. If I accidentally put my finger on it, it felt like a hole would be drilled right away.

Lila narrowed her eyes.

“Is it made by magic?”

“You can see it at a glance.”

Zich sat back down in the chair he had been sitting on.

“It was Orland Dwayne who shot me while I was running away.”

'I said Orlando Dwayne was there too.'

Lyla thought that way and swiped the ice pick in front of her once with her finger.

It is a well-made awl. It has excellent durability and is as cold as freezing cold air.

Even after a certain amount of time has passed since it was created, the state of a wizard could be known just by not destroying its form.

'Because he'll be the next major horseman, this is natural.'

This time, I put my whole hand on the ice. And lightly injected with magic.

"••.uh?"

Lyla's eyes widened. Seeing that, Zich chuckled.

“I thought you would find out soon enough.”

"for a moment! Then this is really... !”

Lyla lifted her whole awl. And it spewed out even more magic. The ice pick received magical power and shone softly.

Seeing that, Zich opened his mouth.

“When I first saw that Elena’s magic had not been released, I had doubts. If she was unable to release her magical powers because of external measures, what was the reason for taking such measures?”

Lyla took her eyes off the ice pick and looked at Zich.

“Is it just because it’s better for the robes to do their job in the future if she doesn’t know her magic? If Gren is really the culprit behind this, I can imagine that he was doing it to make it easier for Elena to come to his party. At the same time, it also prevents Elena from becoming an ally with other people.”

This is a story that makes your blood flow backwards just by hearing the word. If Zich was right, Lyla could grind Gren's face over and over again.

“But then I suddenly had a thought. I wondered if it would be meaningful not only for the future, but also for the measure itself. And that possibility is increased by noticing that No Wet's magic power is constantly being lost."

"no way...."

“Her magic power, magical power, or  talent itself. I thought that the measure might be to send some or all of Elena's things to another place.”

So, he continued to use Knowwet's magic to let Elena practice her magic.

Zich looked at the ice pick. Laila's gaze followed him.

“Did you say Orland Dwayne was originally a quirky wizard?”

"•••okay. And they said that they moved schools and made great strides.”

Contrary to Zich's light words, Lyla's voice was heavier than ever.

“It’s fun. What was the little guy thinking when he saw his daughter? That’s kind of curious.” Lila did not respond to Zich's sarcasm. I just stared intently at the ice pick in front of me.

There was really a little bit of permeation in it. The very weak, but certain energy of the earth that only the ones who always went with Snock and Knowem could feel.

Lyla put the ice pick roughly down on the table. It looks like he's venting his resentment towards Orland on it.

“If your collaborator is Orland Dwayne, you mean he helped turn his father into a Demon King?”

“It is very likely.”

“So he ended up having Elena kill her grandfather.”

"okay."

“How trash!”

“Can I add one more? If Orland was really stealing some of Elena's talents, the reason he supported Elena's magic study until he had a conflict with Wilwes Dwayne would be completely different."

“•••Does Elena's studies become their own strength?”

“I don’t know exactly what Elena is taking away, so I can’t say for sure, but the possibilities are full.”

Lyla was at a loss for words. I can't believe that there is a heartless father who uses his family, and his children, so thoroughly.

“Hey, Zich.”

Lyla asked in a really gloomy and cold voice.

“The little boy, when are you going?”

“Hey, my Laila is mad.”

“I’m not in the mood to joke.”

If Orland is in front of him, he will immediately smash his strongest magic and erase it from the world.

“Unfortunately, I can’t do it right now. So, just be patient.”

I just realized the identity of the culprit. A situation where nothing was prepared.

“This is a law that has to be dealt with gradually. Whether you are looking for evidence or digging a trap, you have to drive it slowly. Well, don't worry. As you know, this is my front door, right?”

Jack laughed. It was the kind of laughter that would make the writers who had suffered from Zich turn their heads in disgust if they saw it.

“Actually, as long as I’m your target, that kid won’t be able to die gracefully.”

"Sure."

Usually, Lila was quite reluctant to use her hands more than necessary for fear of becoming a Demon King, but for this moment, Zich was very reliable.

“Oh, and I have a favor to ask you.”

Zich took a piece of paper from the magic box and handed it to Laila.

“It was given to me by the Jaewick family.”

It was a copy of the password that was tied to Jeonseo-gu's feet.

“Please explain.”

Lyla made an impression.

“Even interpreting the characters of the ancient empire is only in its infancy, are you taking on another task?”

"difficult?"

“Of course it is difficult! If there are any clues or something, I asked them to interpret it recklessly, and if it is interpreted, what am I going to use the password for?”

"okay? Then there is nothing I can do.”

Zich wasn't too disappointed. If there were no other clues, I would have somehow managed to get a clue based on the code, but it was after I found out the dark side after I had already strongly attached to Wilwes. The password has already become something that can be interpreted and it is irrelevant even if it cannot be interpreted.

“Anyway.”

She rolled her eyes lightly at Zich, and Lyla looked at the note Zich had handed her.

"uh?"

"Why? Is there anything strange?”

Lyla hurriedly took a book out of her magic box. Zich recognized the identity of the book.

It was an ancient empire book brought from the Great Forest of Adrowon. Lila opened the book. Zich was also curious, pulled out the dog and looked at the book.

"look."

Lyla pushed the book open in front of Zich. And he placed the note that Zich had brought next to the book.

Zich looked at the book and the note alternately. Wrinkles formed around his eyes.

“Isn’t it similar?”

Jack nodded his head. As Lyla said, the note Zich brought and the letters of the ancient Empire's books were very similar.

“Is it possible that the characters of the ancient empire are being used as passwords?”

“I think so. Even if the two letters are similar, they are very similar.”

"Then you're saying that Wayne Jawick is most likely connected to the Ancient Empire in some way."

Zich looked at me sharply at the note he had copied.

Lyla asked.

“Did you say Wayne Jawick was suspicious? He also said he seems to have noticed that we kidnapped Elena. So you're Orland's friend?"

“It didn’t feel like that. It didn't seem like the two of them were good at all. Of course, it could be a play, but... .”

Zich continued to roll his head. Before being ambushed by Wilwes, I remembered the conversation they had.

'Come to think of it, Wayne Jawick asked Wilwes Dwayne a question that seemed to be floating around.'

For a moment, Zich thought of a possibility.

'Wayne Jawick doesn't know who he's holding hands with?'

Perhaps this is how Jeon Seo-gu is exchanging only passwords.

'The reason why he thought of Willwes Dwayne was because he was assuming that the person he was holding was Wilwes Dwayne.'

Little by little the puzzle is put together.

'If that's the direction Orland Dwayne intended.'

Orland Dwayne was the horseman before returning. And Wilwes Dwayne becomes the Demon King.

'This child. Have you put all your sins on Wilwes and drove him out?'

From there, the Jaewick family may have dealt with it all at once.

'No, it might have been handled by not only the Jawick family but also a few more families. That way, I have a higher chance of going up as a mate.'

"what? His expression became serious. Let me know if you find something.”

Zich told Lyla his guess. Lila opened her mouth slightly.

“••• Are you plotting such a conspiracy?”

“It is still a realm of speculation. I have to check it from now on.”

Zich picked up a note with the password on it.

"Anyway, if Orland is really Orland's way of communicating with Wayne Jawick, then Orland would know this code. And since Orland is considered to be the gang's collaborator... .” Zich stared intently at the note.

“The groves may have something to do with the Ancient Empire.”

“•••After all, it is an ancient empire.”

"okay. Maybe we don't even need to interpret the Empire's characters. Maybe I can figure out how to interpret it from the Orlander.”

Zich trusts Lyla's abilities. I don't know if there are any clues, but now that there are a lot of related materials from the Adrowon Great Forest, if there is time, Lyla will be able to decipher the text.

But there is an easy way, and there is no need to go the hard way.

"It's going to hit Orland Dwayne in the end."

Zich snapped his fingers and made a sound. It sounded like it was coming from Orland's body in the future. Of course, the sound I made then would be much louder and more creepy.

Lyla sighed.

“I’m worried about Elena. It would be a great shock to find out that my father was a traitor, even if I stopped fighting to the death and death with my grandfather later.”

“But you know what to do? No matter how painful it is, the rotten part must be cut out. Otherwise, your life may be in danger.”

“It is.”

“You can comfort me later. You are Elena's teacher, so you will be a little more comforting to Elena than to the bright red person."

“Of course I will. You have to try your best.”

Lyla clenched her fists and firmly packed everything. But things were a little deeper than she thought.

“It may be harder than you think. I think there might be one more thing Orland did. Of course, the case involving Elena.”

“••• Is there anything else?”

“This is an issue that needs to be checked. Is Elena really the first?”

Even though Zich was unkind, Lyla understood correctly.

“Have you done that damn thing to someone else before Elena?”

"lets think. No matter how much he switched to the wife's school, Orlando Dwayne would

He's Weiss Dwayne's son. Naturally, you're more familiar with Will Wes Dwayne's Flew School. Because Wilwes Dwayne must have been teaching him since he was a child. Considering Elena, the future master of fire magic, it's no wonder that Elena's talent doesn't fit the Fleur school. But Orlando Dwayne dared to learn the magic of his wife's school, the Conrod School."

Lyla shut her mouth. And said in a trembling voice.

“••• Not only my daughter, but my wife's magic… !”

“This will have to be timed. When Orland Dwayne's magic suddenly grew, and when Elena's mother died. But if Orland's rapid growth was right after Elena's mother died... .”

Zich stopped talking, but Lila knew what he was trying to say.

Orlando Dwayne killed his wife and took her magical powers.

A great commotion broke out in Snoowick all night, and while Zich was thinking deeply about the truth of the conspiracy, Elena, the root cause of Snuwick's commotion, was sitting comfortably on a chair.

" family?"

“Yes, family.”

Elena nodded her head while hugging Knowwet, who helped her with magic training again today. In front of her sat Snock, who had always been a horse opponent.

Being locked up in an unknown place is quite painful.

Even if it is a situation where you can eat three meals a day and study magic that you like, the fact that you have lost the freedom to go out is enough to drive people psychologically.

If it weren't for Snock's persuasion that it was for Elena's sake and Carwiman's badge of honorary paladin, Elena would have already tried several times to escape, and Hans and Snock would have been in a lot of trouble.

Fortunately, however, Elena quietly practiced magic here. One, it can't be done all day.

At that time, Hans or Snock spoke to me. And for the most part, her opponent was Snock.

Because of this, the two became close enough to be able to share a very deep story. Elena's question came out of such an environment.

“I was suddenly curious. You're out of the house and you're on a trip with Mr. Didn’t your family stop you?”

Now's body stiffened. Apparently, this topic is difficult for Knowwet, who killed Snock's father. Snock noticed this and smiled bitterly.

“I have no family. My brother didn't exist before, and my father and mother had passed away before."

“Ah, Mi, I’m sorry.”

"it's okay. It was a thing of the past.”

Snock shrugged.

“Still, it wasn’t bloody, but there were people who were like family. it's sam He lived next door and he acted like an older brother.”

Snock told his story. life in the arduous mine. It's a life I really hate. But looking back, there was definitely joy and joy there.

Elena listened to Snock's past with interest, which was completely different from her own.

“He was such a person. He was a young subject, and he was like an old man.”

“Are you still a precious person?”

“Well, it is not.”

Snock said, turning his head in embarrassment. His face looked a little red because of the light.

“My grandfather and my father are everything in my family. My mother died ten years ago.”

She stares at the ceiling with dim eyes.

“He was a very kind and kind person. When I was young, I was the happiest when I fell asleep on my mother’s lap and listened to a lullaby.”

Snock nodded. He also had beautiful memories with his mother, so it was not difficult to empathize with him.

“Honestly, it felt like the sky was falling. It felt like I was thrown into the world by myself.”

She continued, wiping the tears from her eyes.

“At the time, my father was really cold to me. No, I didn't get along very well either with me or with my mother."

"okay? It's a little different from what you've heard. Wasn't he a good person to support your dreams?"

“It’s different now, but it used to be. At the time, I was very resentful, but now I understand a little. My father at the time was in a similar situation to me. He was always nervous because he couldn't use his magic properly.”

“I heard that. I heard that he did not give up and continued to work hard and succeeded even late.”

Elena smiled slightly.

"right. The sad thing is that my father's growth took place after my mother passed away. I'm very sorry about that. There really wasn't much of a difference between when my father started to be successful and when my mother died. If my mother had bought a little more, I would have had a happy time with my gentle father.”

Orland Dwayne returned to his mansion. After giving a rough response to the users who bowed down, he entered the bedroom. He took off his robe and threw it on the bed.

I walked to the cupboard in the corner of the room. The cupboard was full of expensive liquor. took one of them out. I grabbed a glass and sat down on the bed.

Amber liquor was poured into the glass. Even with a slight shake, the alcohol seems to overflow out.

Orland tactfully brought it to his lips to keep the drink from flowing and drank it out.

“Great!”

A burning sensation rises in the throat. My mind, which had been clouded by tiredness, flashes.

He exhaled a small breath and drove away the alcohol energy remaining in his mouth. And then I poured the drink again. This drink was quite filling.

widely!

A bottle of wine was placed on the table next to it. Then he moved to the window.

Bump!

When the large window was opened, a small terrace attached to the room appeared. Orland leaned against the railing of the terrace.

I see a city engulfed in darkness. Fireworks were burning everywhere with lights, but it was not enough to drive out the darkness of the city. The body, which had been hot from the drunkenness, cooled slightly by the outside wind.

Take a sip again.

“Damn it”

Suddenly, he spit out a swear word. What had happened a while ago ran through his mind.

Willwes's powerful magic bombardment rained down on the intruders who were stealing their conversations.

It was a sight that easily shattered Orland's pride, which had grown up to be able to show his face at the Supreme Council of the Tower, even though it was the end of the day.

Of course he missed the invaders, but Orland never underestimated Wilwess' abilities. And I was sure.

'No matter what I do, I can't surpass my father.'

very large wall. I thought I could now look beyond my back, but I was mistaken. His back was much larger than he had expected.

Reminds me of old thoughts The cold, indifferent eyes that turned to him who had no talent.

The gaze that always made me shrug my shoulders, the gaze I thought I had overcome now came to mind again.

'Damn it!'

drank again. The glass was cleanly empty.

'Will the plan be successful?' I felt weak. He was fed up with the thought of the huge flame that Wilwes had created towards him.

Moreover, it was not only the greatness of his father who had become aware of the reason that weakened his will now.

'Why do those idiots have to die all of a sudden!'

Thinking of the unidentified group holding hands with him, he sharpened his teeth.

Until now, I had no memory of holding hands with them and losing money. So, I thought this project was also going to be successful enough.

'But I'm sure they'll all die.' There were no survivors, so there was no way of knowing who died for a while. There is still a long way to go before the success of the plan, but all the collaborators are dying.

'Still in a twisted state!'

It is still too early to proceed with the plan. Initially, I planned to keep it as it is for a few more years, but when one variable intervened, everything was twisted.

'Lyla.'

A woman who suddenly appeared to teach Elena's magic. The skill was good, but Orland snorted.

Elena's condition now cannot be resolved even if any famous wizard appears. However, he sided with Elena until he quarreled with Wilwes.

The more Elena studied magic, the better it was for him. No, rather, I couldn't let Elena give up studying magic.

But that was a mistake.

Orland put a hand on his chest. A magical power that faithfully obeys its control at all times.

Before he chants and uses magic, the things that should exist purely are mixed with alien things. The power that began to seep into his body from a certain moment.

'This made it difficult for me to use magic.'

It is said that he lent Elena the magical power of the ghost that Lyla's party had with her for a while so that she could use magic. This is probably because

Besides, that wasn't the only problem.

It was even more dangerous that they noticed something was wrong with Elena's body.

'Father figured it out!'

There was no sign of digging deep right away, but I have no idea how long it will continue to do so.

won't be heard That was a pretty clever move. But even so, I couldn't just believe in it and rest my mind.

As long as he finds out that something's wrong, his father might come to the truth in a way that's really beyond his imagination.

The existence of Snoowick's mage was such an existence.

So, I tried to proceed with the plan in a hurry. However, it got twisted up, and it became a situation where Elena was kidnapped.

Fortunately, it was known who had kidnapped Elena.

'Zeek, Lyla and the others!'

Even now, foreign powers are still being mixed in the magic. It is proof that Elena is continuing to study magic using water exchange.

But there is no direct evidence to drive them by that. Foreign powers cannot be revealed.

'I have to catch the tail somehow!'

And find Elena.

His daughter's presence is very important. She was a very important link to the unknown group.

'They all fell off when they died, but it doesn't matter. I told them that Elena is very important, so another group will come soon.'

Then you can still get help.

'And I have to get some help from Elena until the plan is fully ripe.'

Suddenly, I felt a little guilty. For the sake of his goal, he is obviously using his daughter.

But he shook his head.

'If the father does well, then the children also have their shoulders open. And it won't be like this forever.'

He nodded, trying to erase Elena's face, smiling brightly at him.

'okay. It's unavoidable. Elena, even for me, this plan must succeed. and… .'

Orland tried to move his magic. Although there is a mixture of foreign substances now, the magic that moves according to one's will.

It's 'my' magic.

'It's also for Elena's mother.'

The magic that normally flows smoothly seems a bit rough today.

* * *

The day before, there was a commotion that destroyed the yard of the Jaewick family, but the meeting to exchange information to rescue Elena did not stop.

Elena's abduction was still more important than the intruder who sneaked into the Zawick family.

Moreover, the meeting had to be held even more, as the intruder might have something to do with Elena's abduction.

However, there was one person who did not attend the meeting.

“When is this guy coming?”

Wayne said in an annoyed voice. Being late is definitely something to be offended by, but his annoyance was a little too far-fetched. But it was worth it, it was Zich who was late. The person who was usually dissatisfied was late, so there was no way his tone could be harmonious.

“You don’t think you’ve become something just because you’re in this position, don’t you? That's why I'm a wanderer!"

As Wayne's voice grew louder, the others frowned. Originally, other people's annoyances are not intended to be directed at you, but you don't want to hear them.

But Wayne's displeasure was not incomprehensible, so people didn't say much.

“You are too late Mr. Zich. Send someone first, but it would be a good idea to start the meeting today.” At the other's advice, Wilwes nodded.

The meeting started. But today, there was no such news. We were just talking a few things about the suspicious person who broke into the Jawick mansion the day before.

Today's meeting was also fruitless. People stood up one by one. But until then, Zich had not been seen.

When everyone left and only three people were left, Wilwes, Orland, and Wayne, the man who sent Zich returned.

“Mr. Zich couldn’t come today because he was sick.”

" hurt?"

Wayne frowned.

“If you’re sick, you have to send someone to say you can’t come first, to make you wait recklessly.”

Wayne gave Willwes a few words of Zich's gossip. Wilwes listened quietly.

As the yard of his house was devastated yesterday and the intruder could not be caught, Will Weiss was planning to keep his rain down for a while.

“What do you think?”

Orland could be seen in Wilwes's eyes. Orland spoke quietly.

“I thought it was a little bit crafty.”

“What do you mean?”

“Yesterday’s intruder.”

Wilwes and Wayne's expressions frowned at the same time. But Orland didn't care.

“Obviously, my body was cured with something like a potion, but I was hit with my father’s powerful magic several times. No matter how much treatment you have, there will be limits. In particular, the magic and spirit must have been severely damaged.”

Orland made eye contact with the two.

“There are bound to be consequences. However, the very next day, Mr. Zeek was ill... .”

“He is an intruder!”

Wayne clapped his hands and jumped to his feet. Excited, his breathing was a little rough.

“Not sure.”

Orland said it, but Wayne didn't seem to hear it.

“So I didn't tell you! He's suspicious!"

He spoke quickly, as if he was already convinced that the intruder was Zich.

“Lord of the tower! Let's stop by him right now! If you use the excuse that you came to visit him, he won't say much. Let’s think about it then!”

“So, I said I'm not sure yet!”

Orland spoke a little louder and Wayne looked at him.

"But you're not the one who said he was suspicious this time."

“It is, but… .”

“I don’t mean to bring him back right now. Let’s take a look at where we were yesterday.”

Orland kept his mouth shut as if he had nothing to say here. Wayne looked at Orland once triumphantly, then turned to Wilwess.

“What are you going to do, my lord?”

* * *

Willwes's visit to Zich with Orland and Wayne was always a bit shadowy.

It was around the time it started to fade.

When they arrived, Zich was sitting on the bed and Lyla was next to him.

“Welcome, everyone.”

As Zich tried to stand up, Wilwes waved his hand.

“Don’t get up. because it hurts I am comfortable.”

"thank you. Then I will get a favor.”

Wilwes sat down on the chair next to the bed. Orland and Wayne stood behind him.

“You two, please sit down.”

"Fine. It's kind of like staying with someone who is sick. I'll be leaving soon, so I don't need a chair."

Orland replied. Wayne didn't answer, but looked at Zich. It was to see if there was nowhere to catch the pods.

“Where is the pain?”

Wilwes asked. Zich scratched the back of his head as if embarrassed.

“I seem to have gotten sick after overdoing the fortress. My physical condition was not normal.”

“As the person who caused the crowd, I apologize.”

"no. It's just because my training isn't good enough. And it is entirely my will to save Elena, so there is no need for Matthew to apologize.”

It looks like a warm sight where they care for each other. But Wilwes's eyes moved swiftly, trying to grasp Zich's condition.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 260 screen

Zich and Wilwes chatted for a while. Wilwes asks a question that would normally be asked by a person visiting the hospital, and Zich gives an easy answer.

In the interim, Wilwes asked a question, but Zich didn't give a suspicious answer like a serpent.

Wilwes, who looked at Zich for a moment as if to understand the truth, opened his mouth again.

“Did you hear about yesterday’s commotion?”

“You are talking about the commotion on the Jawick. Yes, I heard. And I saw it too. The fire can be seen from here to the west.”

"okay. Yesterday there was an intruder on Jaywick Street. I went on my own, but unfortunately I missed it. But I've been beaten up quite a bit with magic. I'm sorry to say this, but I'm confident in my magic. No matter how much potions were treated, there would have been some sequelae.”

Jack smiled brightly.

“You are suspicious of me.”

“Are you disappointed?”

“Not at all. I'm the one who said that there might be corpses wearing robes among those attending the meeting. Wouldn't it be too funny if I got angry for being suspicious here? It is true that the timing is complicated.”

“Thank you for thinking that way. Then let’s ask Kim.”

Wilwes narrowed his eyes.

“Are you yesterday’s intruder?”

A heavy tension subsided in the room. Wayne waved his hand as if he wanted to arrest Zich at any moment, and Orlande looked at Willwes and Zich alternately.

"no."

Jack replied.

“Can you prove it?”

“I’m sorry, but I can’t prove it. My colleague's testimony would not be enough to be considered evidence. But I think there are fewer people at that time who can prove they're not the culprits."

Late night when the light disappeared from the sky. Most people spend time at home, so it's hard for others to testify.

"huh! Aren't you making excuses?"

“Then I will ask you back. Do you have any proof that I am the culprit? It's just that the next day, after an accidental commotion, my condition just collapsed. And if a person can be accused of being a criminal just by heart disease, isn't it time for Mr. Jaywick to talk about it?"

" what?"

“Bodies in robes. Have you cleared up your suspicions that they might have something to do with another group suspected of kidnapping Elena?”

“What nonsense! I have nothing to do with them!”

“So am I. I don't know exactly what happened yesterday, but I'm not involved in it either."

“Hey, hey… !”

Wayne's desire to slap Zich with the wand he was holding broke through. But Zich just looked at him calmly. Wayne didn't want it to look any worse.

“Then can you say that it has nothing to do with yesterday?”

"That's right."

"Right."

Wilwes stood up.

“I heard you well. It would be rude to hold on to someone who is sick more than this. I want you to take good care of yourself.”

Turning his back, Wilwes looked at Zich again.

"It's a bit odd to ask you this right now, but can you still get help with finding Elena?"

“Don't worry about that. Tomorrow it will be restored. Then we have to go find it again.”

“Thank you.”

As if all doubts had been resolved, Wilwes nodded. Then Wayne intervened.

“By the way, when are you going to let the servants meet?”

“Are you Hans and Snock? I'll be back in a few days. We'll take you to the meeting as soon as we get back."

As if to let it go, Wayne stepped back with a viper-like glance.

“Stop.”

Wilwes took Wayne and Orland out of the room. Orland bowed slightly before leaving, but Wayne didn't even make eye contact with Zich.

“What do you think?”

Wayne asked when he left the dorm. Will Weiss turned his head to look at the dark spot where Zich's room was.

“At least there was nothing strange about the remarks.”

"However… .”

“But it is also true that the timing is ingenious and questionable.”

Wayne's face brightened.

"sure! I doubt it! Now, even the Lord of Matthew knows my heart!”

“It is not determined that he is the culprit. But I think we need to take a closer look.”

"sure! sure!"

Sticking to Wilwes's side, Wayne fervently agrees. It seemed he was very happy that Wilwes had begun to cast a suspicious look on Zich.

Wayne sat next to Willwes, arguing with Zich's gossip. And Orland watched him quietly from behind.

As Wilwes and the group left the room, Zich lay down for a moment in bed. But for a while. As their presence moved away from the dormitory, they jumped up.

“Congratulations on your recovery.”

Lyla's soulless congratulations sounded meaningless.

"thanks."

After answering Zich relentlessly, he got out of bed.

Contrary to what Zich had said so far, his appearance did not show any pain. Rather, it looked like he couldn't move his body.

“I’m hungry because I’m after being sick.”

“It’s clever.”

Seeing Zich stroking her stomach, Lyla booed. Zich put on a sad expression.

“Isn’t it too much for someone who was sick?”

“If you were really sick, I would have behaved differently.”

But Zich was not sick. It was very healthy.

Zich sat down on the bed. Lyla's eyes followed him.

“But are you really okay? From what I heard, it seems that he was struck by a magic of considerable power.”

“Because my body is too strong to leave only that much aftereffect.”

Zich shrugged and said.

“Willwes Dwayne seems suspicious of you.”

said Lyla. If true, it wouldn't be a good thing for them. However, what Laila said next was the exact opposite.

“It’s your plan.”

“If the timing is so ingenious, there will naturally be doubts that were not there.”

“Are you really okay? This is definitely helping Orland.”

" right."

Zich nodded meekly.

“And that’s what I meant.”

“You are trying to get back to work hard.”

“What afresh. Originally I was that kind of guy. I will definitely do good things, but the process has to be my own.”

Zich smiled at Orland. Lila, on the other hand, sighed.

“Once I said I was helping you. So I'll go with what you think. But please ease Elena's pain as much as possible. That kid doesn't matter."

“You try, but you know it’s impossible, right? As the dark side is my father, unless I cover up the incident at all, I can't help but get hurt. The reason he suffered was because of his father, he tried to bring down his grandfather, and he may have used his mother as well and then killed him.”

“•••It is so.”

Even as a clever woman, she only shook her head sadly, wondering if she couldn't think of a way to prevent the catastrophe to come.

“The only thing I can do for Elena now is to correct the distortions so far and the things that will happen in the future. So, if it's for Elena, you should be prepared."

Lila quietly nodded at Zich's serious words.

As stated, Zich returned to the meeting the next day. A few days later, Hans and Snock were invited to the meeting and introduced.

Wayne sharply questioned the two of them, but they didn't get much profit from their answers.

I tried to induce them by changing various questions, but to no avail. At first, the answer itself was very simple.

They said they were just homeless outside the castle, looking for suspicious spots.

They even tried to imagine the topography around the city, but the two answered quickly about the topography nearby.

And Wayne didn't really know about the terrain a little further from the city.

Eventually, Wayne let them go.

After the meeting, Hans and Snock were taken back by Zich. I didn't get the answer I was looking for, but unexpectedly, Wayne's expression was dull.

He did not return, waiting for Wilwes and the two to remain. This time, Orland sat with us, but Wayne ignored Orland and talked as if he was familiar with it.

“Let us follow in the footsteps of Zich's servants.” Orland made an impression.

“Isn’t it over with just one question?”

“Who can stop doubting with just one question like that? Anyway, the answer was exactly what I expected. Rather, we will find out now.”

And Wayne looked at Wilwes again.

“If they really had kidnapped Miss Dwayne, they would have been watching. I brought them both now to avoid suspicion, but I'll send them back soon. It would be unsettling to leave Miss Dwayne alone. Then you have to catch up.”

“Didn’t I say that I added people but missed them every time? But how are you going to do it? Are you going to ask for a companion?”

Orland, who intervened again, was swearing at him, but Wayne pressed it firmly and responded.

“I can’t ask you to accompany me. I'm sure he'll refuse for a number of reasons, and even if he does, he'll never guide Miss Dwayne."

Wayne's gaze turned to Wilwess again.

“Until now, I had been thinking about how on earth I would avoid the gaze of the tails I had attached, but if the last intruder was him, I can guess the reason to some extent.”

“Transparency artifact.”

As Wilwes mumbled, Wayne nodded.

“Even if you are an expert in following or tracking, it will be easy to be deceived if you borrow power from great magic.”

As it was probably a wizard, the people gathered here had no choice but to overestimate magic a little more than other skills. But aside from the evaluation, Wayne's words were quite convincing.

“So, I plan to send a skilled magician as a watcher. If they really kidnapped Miss Dwayne, they will guide us to her.”

“Didn’t you say you put watchers on them?”

"That's right."

“Are you still wearing it?”

"Yes."

“Then let me know if the servants show any signs of moving.”

Wayne blinked at the unexpected words.

“What do you mean?”

“I will pursue the chase.”

Wayne and Orland were surprised.

"Yes? How could the Master Matthew do such a thing... !”

“It’s my granddaughter’s business. If I don't go, who will?"

Wilwes said firmly.

“Besides, the last intruder's artifact boasted a great deal of performance. There was very little magical power perceived from the outside. That's not why the two of them didn't notice."

Wayne bowed his head slightly in embarrassment, and Orland scratched his face.

The fact that both of them could not properly grasp the magic nearby as a magician at the top of the tower was embarrassing and hurt their self-esteem.

“I have no intention of smashing the two of you. I barely noticed, too, so it must be said that the performance of that artifact is excellent. If Mr. Zich's servants have the same or similar one, the other wizards may miss it. To be sure, I'd be better off moving myself."

“But still… .”

“I know that public opinion about this case is slowly going in the wrong direction.”

Since the granddaughter of Snuwick's most powerful man was kidnapped, they were almost poking around the city to search the city, but the fatigue of the citizens was also accumulating.

Right now, we are following along, but after a little while, there may be a backlash. There was already such an atmosphere under the water.

People also have their own lives.

“So whatever you do, you have to finish this job quickly. It would be better for me to do that myself.”

Wayne couldn't stop Willwes any more.

Zich came out of Snoowick. It had been a long time since I had left the city. But it didn't go far. At least I stopped right in front of the castle gate.

The reason he came out was to see off Hans and Snock.

“Are you ready?”

"Yes!"

“Certainly did it!”

The two answered in a voice that was not very loud, but the spirit was clearly entered.

“Well, there was nothing to prepare.”

After all, the basics were stocked in the magic box, so they had nothing to prepare other than filling the consumed ingredients.

Of course, preparation was not only material.

“Do you remember what I said?”

This time, the two answered right away. There's no way they won't remember what Zich said. Even if I wanted to forget it, the hard training I had received until now instinctively engraved Zich's words into my head.

Zich, who nodded at their satisfactory answer, tapped their shoulders. Then he thrust his face between the faces of Hans and Snock.

“There was a misfortune. Don't move your head."

Hans and Snock, who were unconsciously trying to look around, hurriedly squeezed their necks and stopped their faces.

“Just do what you plan. Then you'll be fine. Understand?"

Hans and Snock nodded.

"great. Then go.”

Zich turned around and patted them on the back. Hans and Snock left the majestic wall behind and headed forward.

Zich, who looked at Hans and Snock's back for a moment, turned around. I started walking towards the gate.

'You've come across a pretty great person.'

Zich only moved his eyes and looked up at the top of the castle wall slightly. It felt like a weak presence there. However, the exact location was not known.

'The concealment technology is quite good.'

The fact that Zich, who had a great talent for detecting presence, could not detect properly even though he thought that there was a high probability of coming this time, was able to tell the opponent's ability.

'Is it magic?'

Apparently, it was a case of approaching a city famous for magic, so there was a good chance that a high-class magician would come out.

'I just showed openly that I use invisibility artifacts.'

However, it seemed that the level of the opponent was higher than what Zich had expected.

'Wait, did the master of the mage come out himself?'

Come to think of it, there was a possibility.

'If that's the case, it's a little risky.'

At that moment, he felt the flag he was sensing shaking a little.

'It's moving.'

It was clear that he was also trying to follow in the footsteps of Hans and Snock to find out where Elena was.

Although moving, the sign is still very faint. Indeed, it is highly likely that Wilwes Dwayne Bourne has arrived.

Zich looked back at Han Su and Snock, who had already gone that far.

He must be tense, but that doesn't mean his body is rigid. Both are maintaining moderately good tension.

Jack smiled bitterly.

'You'll be fine.'

It's not meant to go head-to-head, and there's not much of a chance that Wilwes will attack right away, Zich thought.

'And the skills of these guys aren't that great either.'

Zich turns and goes back into the city.

headed to

'You're in.'

From the air, Wilwes watched silently as Zich entered the gates. There is no sense of suffocation. Wilwes averted his gaze from Zich.

'He will be monitored by the guards assigned by the Jaewick family.'

It's not Zich that matters now. Will Weiss' body moved. A secret but strong flowing magical energy gushed and guided his body.

Hans and Snock were walking along the boulevard that stretched out of the gate, and at some point they leaked sideways.

The two set foot on a grassy meadow overgrown with weeds, where there were no well-maintained roads or even small cattle.

Wilwess focused. As long as they are off the road, you never know when they will disappear from view. With his eyes wide open, Wilwes followed Hans and Snock slowly from the ball in the distance.

The two went through the meadow and into a small forest of trees.

'Your view is obscured.'

Wilwes frowned. lower the altitude However, Wilwes rather raised the altitude.

The size of the forest was not very large. If you look at it from a high place, you can see the entire forest. It was easy to figure out which direction the two of them would come out of the forest.

Of course, he sharpened his sense of magic. Because they could have used invisibility artifacts. And Wilwess' suspicions were exactly right.

Whoa!

A faint change that ordinary people could not feel caught his senses.

'I used it!'

Wilwes closed his eyes. And I tried to feel the magical energy better. A magical energy began to move.

A very faint vibe. The mediocre wizards are so secretive that you can't even feel their energy even in front of them.

'It's similar to the energy I felt in the Jaewick family.'

If you really follow them, you may meet your granddaughter.

A magical energy came out of the forest. was not seen with the naked eye. But there was definitely something there.

I could still feel the magical energy, and if I focused on it, I could see some awkwardness in the space.

The magical energy continued to move. It has already moved a considerable distance.

'Where are you going?'

There is still room for magic. It is not that the rank of the top owner was obtained by luck. However, it was also true that his magic had a limit.

'Of course I don't think it's going to be that long.' Still, there is one thing. Moreover, the movement speed of the opponent was also beyond imagination. It was constantly moving at the speed of an ordinary person sprinting.

But luckily, his worries were in vain.

Suddenly, the magical energy shook, revealing Hans and Snock. It was as if the time of the Artifact had ended.

They soon began to climb nearby mountains. As we climbed to the top of the mountain, we saw an old house. It was supposed to be a hut for hunters and such, but it was abandoned or quite torn down. However, the recent reinforcement has somehow managed to meet the purpose of residence.

Seeing it there, Wilwes tilted his head.

'Is Elena locked up in a place like that?'

It looks like a very easy place to escape. It didn't seem like the word confinement really fit.

'Have you ever been tied up?'

Wilwes' worries grew even more. It was because he imagined his granddaughter who would be chained up without food or even a sip of water in the absence of Hans and Snock.

But fortunately that wasn't the case.

thud! thud!

Hans knocked on the door and the door opened.

' Armor?'

Seeing the one who opened the door, Wilwes narrowed his eyes. It was the one who was wearing silver-colored armor.

'Were there any accomplices?'

Then I understand.

'Weren't you just a traveler?'

Even with such armed forces as companions, the involvement of outside forces is of course suspicious. However, the movement of the armor seemed awkward.

'No, it's a golem.'

A golem made of armor. If something like that was on guard, it's understandable that Elena didn't even try to escape.

Wilwes looked around the hut quietly. I couldn't get close, just in case

Several windows were visible. Unlike a torn down house, the windows were firmly wrought with grates. The suspicion that Elena might be in custody deepened.

Moving around, I tried to look inside through the window.

and found His granddaughter was in the house.

relief. and anger. Wilwes' emotions showed extreme up-and-down movements. The feeling of betrayal that he had deceived himself and Elena was bitter, and he felt pity for the wounds Elena must have suffered.

I wanted to burn everything in front of me right away and fly to the city to burn Zich and Leila.

But he persevered. There's never a lot of redness that makes things better at any time. Especially now, his granddaughter is kidnapped by the enemy.

Wilwes turned his gaze down from the rising heat into the cabin.

Except for Elena, there were only two people in the house, Hans and Snock. There was more movement, but they were all golem-like armor.

Fortunately, Elena was in good shape, but it didn't seem like she was tortured.

She was sitting still on the bed. It seems free at first glance, but seeing armor-clad golems lounging nearby, it must not be as free as it seems.

Everything to check is done. Wilwes quietly stepped back. His eyes turned to Elena.

'Wait a minute, Elena. Please do not save me!'

It was very heartbreaking to have to leave my granddaughter in the hands of the enemy, but I couldn't help it.

As Snuwick's mage master and for Elena's sake, he had to uproot the enemy's roots.

'You can't miss a single thing!'

Taking his eyes off his granddaughter and moving his feet to keep him from falling, he left the front of the hut.

It's been quite some time since Wilwes left the hut. The sky had already darkened, and only the moon and stars were desperately blocking the invasion of darkness.

Even in the hut, the flames from the candles were softly illuminating the inside.

Elena, who was sitting still on the bed, said sullenly.

“Hey, how long do I have to wait?”

Hans and Snock, who were sitting face to face at the table playing cards and killing time, turned to Elena and then looked at each other.

“Will it be okay soon?”

“Maybe it will.”

Hans nodded at Snock's question.

"What are you saying!"

Elena was annoyed. Hans and Snock had a conversation with their voices shut so that Elena could not hear them.

"Nothing." Snock tapped the paddle on his shoulder. Nowet jumped off his shoulder. Then he climbed onto Elena's lap.

Elena's complexion brightened a little. Snock, who had been away from the hut for several days, was unable to study magic properly. Besides, even after returning, he hadn't borrowed the know for a while.

For Elena, whose only pleasure was studying magic while imprisoned, it was extremely annoying. However, when I was able to study magic again, my mind relaxed slightly.

She hugged Nowtm and looked at Snock.

“Where have you been?”

Unlike Han Su, whose face was often all she had, Snock was always by her side. But a few days ago, both of them were gone. Instead, only a golem in the form of an armor was left.

“I can’t speak.”

That's what I expected But that didn't make me feel bad.

"huh!"

Elena snorted in annoyance. As she was practicing her magic again, a golem came into her eyes.

A golem released by Snok to keep an eye on him. It was annoying, but the magician's curiosity could not be helped.

“Teacher… Did you say that Lyla made it?”

He insists that there is no bad intention and knows that his situation is different from that of a normal hostage, but one of the people in the party who is still taking away his freedom is Lailara.

"right."

“It's not great performance, but it's perfect. You must have suffered quite a bit.”

"okay? Are you making it quickly?”

Snock responded while chewing a can of root plant around him. However, unlike Snock, who knew nothing, Elena was at a loss for words.

“••• Will you make this soon?”

Elena had to admit that whether she was a good person or a bad person, she really had a magical talent.

Hans watched quietly as Snock and Elena had a conversation, and then looked out the window.

'Jeek-nim said if there was going to be a raid, it would start soon after we entered the hut.'

But nothing happened today. That means that another situation that Zich had expected soon unfolded.

'I'm sure they got caught here, but at least it's fine today.'

There was no need to signal Zich. Perhaps the start of the case will begin where Zich is.

Hans put Estelaide next to him and watched Snock and Elena flirting with each other after putting clasps on the back of their heads.

Snoowick makes a fuss. A significant number of troops were seen circling through the city. Citizens look at the scene with anxious eyes.

Citizens are under a lot of stress due to various incidents taking place in Snoowick recently.

However, when the soldiers in the city suddenly showed a large-scale movement, the stress was inevitably aggravated even more.

Zich asked to buy a broken one raised a fruit stand. And I looked at the history of the city spreading nine-seat corner.

From a distance, I could hear people talking.

“What the hell is it? Has there ever been a war?”

“It’s a riot to find the granddaughter of the Lord Matthew.”

"Granddaughter? You've been looking for it all along."

“It didn’t work out. So from now on, they will mobilize all the troops they call to take over the city.”

“You’re going to mobilize troops. So what are the soldiers who have been walking around so far?”

“I mean, literally, we’re going to mobilize all of us. No matter how safe this city is because of the tower, it basically needs troops to protect it. Even if the soldiers were mobilized, at least the basic troops to protect the city were on standby.”

"for a moment! So you're going to mobilize all the soldiers to protect the city?"

“I would. The troops are already divided outside. It's going to rip you out of town." Zich listened to the conversation between the two. Look at the troops again. I felt that the eyes of people looking at them were not pretty.

Is the reason for mobilizing so many troops really the same as the rumors spread among people? Until he endured such unpretentious gazes from the citizens.

At the first meeting, it was said that troops would be mobilized for the same reasons as the current rumors. There was quite a bit of opposition, but Wilwes really pushed it. Among those in the meeting were some who said that Wilwess' patience had reached its limit, and a few murmured that Wilwes had finally gone crazy.

But Zich didn't think so.

swish!

The flesh disappeared, and only the seeds were thrown by the male Zich. After wiping the corner of his mouth to wipe the juice from his lips, Ji-ke smiled meaningfully.

Something quite tumultuous awaited me.

two days later. Zich went to the meeting.

Now it seems like a familiar way to go to work. A few days ago, soldiers roaming the city were still prowling the streets.

Bump!

As usual, I opened the door and went in. Many people were already gathered inside. It seemed that everyone except for Zich had arrived.

Zich didn't come late. Zich was originally a middle-aged person.

“Everyone came early.”

Zich greeted him casually and went to his seat.

“There is still some time until the meeting, but everyone is gathered, so let’s start early today.”

At Wilwes's suggestion, people nodded their heads warmly. It was a little strange. There were often days when people gathered early, but then the meeting was not ahead of time.

But Zich agreed with Wilwes without any complaints.

“This meeting is to find my granddaughter, Elena Dwayne.”

Will Lewis began speaking about the significance of this meeting without Famous. Riga If you do not already know one person who participated in the meeting. But he did not file a statement of anyone.

“But this meeting is no longer necessary.”

Wilwes stared intently at Zich.

So are the others. Everyone's eyes were focused on Zich.

The atmosphere is definitely strange. Zich looks around.

There was a clear opposition to the enemy in his gaze. some live

was holding on

Jack laughed. So far, he's been polite to some degree. But his actions were far from polite.

I leaned back on the backrest and crossed my legs. Such an attitude that no one can tell that he looks polite.

“Looks like you got caught.”

He spoke like that in a calm tone, ignoring the hostile gaze towards him.

"Yes, that's right. I kidnapped Elena.”

Silence descended.

People looked at Zich with bewildered eyes.

I was contacted separately and came early to hear that Zich was the culprit. Naturally, they were angry at the fact that the author who kidnapped Elena was making fun of them while attending the meeting.

A single word from Wilwess would bring condemnation to that cheeky criminal.

But they imagined was Siegfried yieotji look for results beat struggling countries to escape the pursuing of his ugly, jeoreot I did not even had much accused Patagonia naebaetneun the albino appearance of their sins. Besides coming to look like that one episode.

It seemed that Wilwes didn't like Zich's appearance too much.

“Did you kidnap me? Did you say that now?”

Johndae disappeared from Wilwes' words.

“You already know everything, don’t you? I think that’s why you prepared this stage.”

Zich glanced at the door.

bang!

The door slammed open and the soldiers rushed in. Shiny spear swords and hard armor glistened.

They surrounded Zich and raised their spears.

A sharp spear blade pushed in to the front of his neck, but Zich didn't budge.

“If you admit everything, this is convenient too.”

Wilwes got up. His cold eyes stared at Zich.

"You'd better just spit out everything you know. If you want to reduce the pain even a little. Your comrades will all be dragged to your side soon. So if you're looking for help, don't even dream of it."

“Don't worry. I'm not worried about that at all."

“•••Why are you so calm? Would you like to be able to run away in this situation?”

Wilwes scoffed at Zich, who didn't break his attitude.

There is no room to run away. Around him, there were a number of wizards, including Wilwes himself, the strongest wizard in Snoo Week.

In addition, the troops that are besieging Zeek are also among the elite in Snoowick. Neither quality nor quantity can be dealt with by Zich alone.

However, it was also true that Zich's attitude felt uncomfortable.

Wilwes blinked. It was a signal to pull Zich away.

The spear knife that was aimed at Zich drew closer. If you push in a little more, there will be a hole in Zich's body.

While some soldiers were keeping Zich in check, soldiers with chains approached.

It was alloyed with rare metals such as mithril, so it was much harder than ordinary chains.

“Let me ask you something.”

Jack asked. It's still a casual fisherman.

"What."

“Other forces were trying to kidnap Elena. Did you know about the robes?”

“•••I haven't figured it out yet. I'll think about it after I catch you."

“They are the ones who tried to kidnap Elena. I'm sure I stole Elena they were kidnapping."

“I have no reason to believe what you say, and even if what you say is true, I have no intention of listening to it right now.”

“I am not asking you to believe me. You are talking about your true enemy.”

“A real enemy?”

“Yes, the real enemy.”

A few people around him look embarrassed. But Wilwes' complexion remained the same.

"If you say you want to Be a later date. Soon thing I want to say well I'll have to say to you that you do not want to say. "

As Wilwes raised his hand, the soldiers put chains around Zich's body. The nearby wizards also pointed their wands at Zich. The same goes for Wilwes. There was a risk that Zeek would work with artifacts, so Wilwes' wand was already lightly swamped with magical power.

“I warn you again, but don't even think about it! Soldiers aren't the only ones here."

"I know. Here, of course, the soldiers will besiege Lyla's quarters and Hans and Snock's out-of-town huts. Aren't you ignoring the complaints of the citizens to hide it and moving your troops loudly?"

Wilwes's expression, which had not changed no matter what Zich said, changed for the first time.

“•••You are quick to notice.”

“I do take a look. Otherwise, kidnapping will not work properly.”

“But now it’s too late to notice.”

“No, it’s not too late yet.”

Jack smiled broadly.

No matter how much I think about it, there is no way to escape. But Wilwess felt uneasy at Zich's smile.

“Hurry up!”

The soldiers who were tying the chains moved a little faster.

But that was in vain.

Whoo!

The magic moved. It is clear that you used artifacts.

“Stop it!”

Willwes exclaimed.

He has already informed others of how to respond in case of an emergency. Most of them were skilled and experienced wizards, so the wizards' movements were also agile.

Whether he used invisibility magic as before or attack magic, they were all able to respond.

However, the magic that Zich used was not that simple.

“See you later.”

After those words, Zich's body disappeared. The chain fell helplessly.

“What, invisibility!”

“Stop it! Surround yourself with your body!”

The soldiers hurriedly overlap their bodies without leaking.

“Damn, how did you break the chain!”

“First, stop him from escaping! Think about the reason later! Invisibility cannot completely disappear from view! Find the distorted space!”

“No matter how high-level transparency artifacts are, there are bound to be limitations.”

The wizards also shouted and tried to find Zich by mobilizing various magic.

However, even here, including Willwes, the faces of the highest-ranking wizards were hardened.

“•••It is useless.”

Wayne stopped people from shivering in Busan.

“It’s no use, what do you mean!”

“He is no longer here.”

" Yes?"

How did you get out of this impenetrable siege?

But the prestigious jaeweek is the word of the state. can't hear in vain

“Even if you leave the building, you'll still be around! I will order a search immediately!”

The commander who commanded the soldiers said hastily. But Wayne said a little nervously.

“It’s no use! There will be none around here anyway!”

“What… !”

Wayne approached Wilwess, unwilling to answer the Commander's questions any further.

“I think we underestimated his abilities too much.”

“… that's no Who would have expected to have such a thing?” If their guess is correct, it means that even the owner of the tower, Wilwes, did not dare possess it.

An object that is questionable as having as much as the emperor of a large country.

“What the hell is the situation!”

the commander asked. Wilwes answered quietly.

“Looks like he has a teleportation artifact.”

“… Yes?"

“What!”

"Nonsense;"

Unlike the commander who vomited embarrassment, the wizards were startled.

Artifacts that can teleport are so precious.

A wizard as tall as Wilwess can use teleportation, but giving it to an artifact is something else.

“Then it probably won’t be around here anymore.”

Unlike sorcerers who were startled, the commander was faithful to his job.

“If there is no other clue, I will send troops to the place where the other party is.”

“We will go too.”

As Wilwes moved, so did the other wizards.

* * *

fault!

Zich stepped in. He arrived at Lyla's room.

Lyla, who had already finished preparing to go out, looked out the window and then turned her head.


Jack said to her.

" let's go."

(Continued on next page)


# No. 263 screen

“It’s not too late to come.”

Lyla lowered the wand she was holding. A little while ago, her wand was pointing out the window.

“Well written.”

Zich threw a teleportation artifact at Lyla.

“Did you come a lot?”

“Make it squishy.” Zich, who stood next to Laila, looked out the window. Armed forces were swarming around the house, just as she said. The weapons they were carrying and the armor they wore reflected the sunlight, almost dazzling.

“Did you pack all your things?”

“I finished it last night.”

“Is there anything missing?”

“Am I a kid?”

Lyla gave a pincup and held up a magic box. I mean, it's already been put there.

“Then let’s go. I have no reason to be here anymore. after a little while

Dangerous people may come” rr rz ।

1——I——r!

There was a commotion outside the window. The troops surrounding the dormitory began to move.

I saw them slam the front door of the dormitory open and rush in. Shortly thereafter, you will enter the room with Zich and Lyla.

Lyla raised her wand. Magical energy flowed from her body and wrapped around Zich and her body. Lyla chanted and manipulated her magical powers.

Whoops!

Zich and Lyla's bodies disappeared. When even the slight reverberation left in the space spreads to all directions, the traces of their presence have disappeared neatly.

quaang

Moments later, the hinges on the door came off and the door flew in. And then the soldiers came. But it was only in the empty room that they welcomed them.

The furniture was overturned and the room was searched, but no traces of people were found anywhere.

At the same time, soldiers also entered the hut where Hans and Snock were. But all they met was an open tunnel in the corner of the hut. It was also blocked in the middle, so no one knew where they ran.

It was a moment that even the last Zich and his party had missed in vain.

But it was not without their harvest.

“Let the city know.”

The commander who commanded the soldiers gave orders to his subordinates.

“You found Miss Elena Dwayne.” A Japanese raid on Zich's group. However, despite the anxiety and dissatisfaction of the citizens and the super strong force of mobilizing the majority of the city's soldiers, the mission to capture Zich's party was completely unsuccessful.

Even if the opponent's ability is higher than they thought, failure is failure.

As long as it was the owner of the tower, Wilwes Dwayne, who carried out this operation, his position would have been severely damaged.

But for now, such a political position didn't matter to Wilwess. He was overjoyed to see the granddaughter who returned well.

Wilwes has a lot of work to do in the future, but at least people haven't bothered him as much as he does now.

“Mr. Dwayne, aren’t you over there?”

A wizard asked Orland. Wilwes hugged Elena and looked for any injuries, but her father, Orland, had taken a few steps back.

“I plan to go there after my father leaves. You must be more sympathetic to us because we live together.”

"exactly?"

It made sense, so he nodded and walked away.

Orland stood still and watched Willwes and Elena. go there for a while He sighed a little and said quietly.

“If only my father was like that to me… .”

soft sigh. What followed is a bit of a question mark.

“But how can a person change like that?”

But soon he shook his head.

“It must be because you have changed. Maybe it's acting."

And Orland went forward. Slowly, Wilwes and Elena's reunion seemed to be coming to an end, so she stood to join.

Orland's murmur was small, but once it came out of his mouth, anyone could hear it. It was Wayne, who was closest to him, who heard him this time.

He looked vaguely at Orland's back. He turned his gaze to Wilwess, smiled slightly to see if he had something on his mind, and nodded.

But on Orland's face he built

He didn't know that a smile similar to that passed by.

I was very happy to save Elena, but it was only for a while. Wilwess asked about when and after she was kidnapped. Now it was time to do the post-processing.

Hearing Elena's story, Wilwes was relieved for the first time. Surprisingly, she wasn't in a bad mood. But the more I listened to the story, the more strange it became.

The kidnappers made no unreasonable demands on her. It was said that there were no restrictions on behavior, except that they were not allowed to go outside.

Rather, he even said that he made it convenient so that he could even study magic.

Perhaps because of that, there was no hostility in Elena's tone.

As Elena, who had been kidnapped, gave off such an atmosphere, naturally Wilwes's hostility toward Zich and the others softened a little.

But that's it. The result of their kidnapping Elena and making fun of herself does not change. The search had to continue. At that moment, Wilwes heard a shocking word from Elena.

“The honorary paladin of Carwiman?”

Wilwes, of course, was astonished by the others. Even in Snuwick, the city of wizards, there are many followers of Karwiman.

It is the place called Carwiman that forms such a powerful force. In addition, it does not give the honorary paladin title. But, that Carwiman's honorary paladin is a kidnapper.

If true, this is a big event in any sense.

Wilwes asked urgently.

“Is that true?”

"Yes. Snock showed me the badge of honorary paladin that he got it from Mr. Zich.”

“Do you remember what it looked like?”

"Yes."

Elena drew the mark she had seen on a piece of paper. I am not good at drawing, so I couldn't draw in detail, but if I knew the original, I was able to recognize it enough.

“… Are you sure it looks like this?”

"Yes."

I was surprised that I checked it several times

Elena could certainly nod her head.

Wilwes sighed. It was a sigh of relief, not a sigh of relief when I was worried about something. A wizard who looked at the picture with Wilwes grinned.

“It’s fake. Then yes. Could the kidnapper be Carwiman's honorary paladin?"

"Yes? Fake?”

Elena rolled her eyes. Wilwes nodded, clearing Elena's drawing.

“The mark of Carwiman’s Honorable Paladin didn’t come like this. I'm sure I've seen it."

Elena opened her mouth. I felt betrayed by Snock, who showed me proudly.

But everyone except Elena was very relieved.

“It is, too. It is said that Carwiman's honorary paladin is more difficult than becoming an official paladin. There is no way such a person would do such a horrific thing as kidnapping.”

“It seems that she lied to make Ms. Dwayne, who is still inexperienced, to be docile.”

“Fortunately, he doesn't seem to have done anything bad to Miss Dwayne, but he must have been thinking something bad. Be sure to catch him and bury him!”

people are talking Elena looked at the picture she had drawn, which had fallen casually.

Did Zich and the others really have a bad heart and completely deceived themselves? Her heart was heavy.

A few days after Elena is rescued safely. Orland returned to his home.

After rescuing Elena, a large-scale search ceased, but the culprit has not yet been caught, so it is not yet fully returned to daily life.

Helena's father was still helping Will Weiss in finding Zich and the others.

Entering the room feeling tired, he took off his robe as usual, put his wand, and lit a candle.

stop!

He looked back and stopped moving. Someone was sitting on a chair.

It was surprising that an intruder broke into his room, but the intruder was a person he knew well.

couldn't know Because he was the one they were desperately looking for now.

“Geek.”

put his name in his mouth. Jack smiled and stood up.

"How were you?"

“Because of you and your co-workers, I haven’t been doing very well.”

Orland took a step back. I glance at the wand. I calculated whether I should spread the magic with my bare hands or grab the staff even if it was a little late.

However, Zich held out his hand, indicating that he had no intention of being hostile.

“I am here to talk today. I have no intention of fighting.”

“Do you think I would believe that when the man who kidnapped my daughter sneaked into the house?”

“Didn’t you hear from Elena? I am the honorary paladin of Carwiman.”

Orland snorted.

“I heard. And that what I showed you as a proof is a crude fake that looks like it was made in a cheap workshop.”

“It would be. What I showed Elena was fake.”

Zich threw something. Orland, who had instinctively caught it, was startled. He quickly threw it to the floor, wondering if what he was holding was a dangerous thing.

Fortunately, it doesn't seem to cause any harm. It made a thumping sound as it hit the floor. Orland looked at it closely.

"This… !”

Confused, he lifted it up again and looked at it closely in the light of the candle.

“It’s definitely genuine, but what do you think?”

“•••It’s the same.”

That was definitely the mark that Carwiman gave to the Honorable Paladin.

“Can you please return it to me when you confirm it?”

Orland threw a token at Zich. and asked.

“How did you get it? That wouldn't be a rude thing to give."

“He trampled on his most hated and hated enemy.”

“•••It must have taken some serious damage to Valid.”

For that reason, it would be enough to qualify as an honorary knight. Of course, the blow has to be no ordinary scale.

“But I just can’t believe it. Because it could be fake.”

“Of course, I am not asking you to believe this alone. But wouldn’t it be enough to have a conversation?”

Orland looked at Zich suspiciously. But after some thought, he nodded.

"great. But, I will hold the wand. And keep the distance like this. I mean, it won't be a problem for us to talk."

“Let’s do that.”

Without taking his eyes off Zeek, Orland grabbed his wand. As I felt a firm touch in my hand, a little peace came to me. The head also seems to spin more easily than before.

Orland said more leisurely than before.

“Then tell me. Why did you come to me?”

“I have come to ask you for help.”

" help?"

"That's right. You know that not long ago, on the day Elena was kidnapped, bodies in robes appeared outside the castle.”

"okay. Those who kidnapped Elena.”

Elena had already been told that they kidnapped Elena from the mansion and took her out of the castle, after which Hans and Snock killed them all and re-abducted Elena.

“They are the ones I am pursuing. They are very wicked and bad people.”

"okay?"

“I am really sorry for kidnapping Elena, but it was to protect her. It's not safe to kill those robes. They always have collaborators. I tried to find the allies while protecting her.”

“I don’t know who the enemy is, but then at least you should have told me or my father!”

Orland said strongly. To that, Zik replied sternly.

"To be honest, I was suspicious of you both, Elena's grandfather, Wilwes Dwayne, and father, Orland Dwayne."

“What!”

“And as a result of the investigation so far, we have identified a collaborator.”

As Orland's hand twitched, Zich said.

"The collaborator is obviously Elena's grandfather, Will Wes Dwayne."

When Zich brought up the robes, he pretended to be calm, but Orland was very nervous.

There, when Zich said that he was suspicious of him, he flinched as he wanted to attack immediately.

What he was able to put up with was his concern that the claim that Zich was Carwiman's honorary paladin could be true.

But when Zich said he thought Wilwes was the culprit, he barely resisted the desire to raise his hands and shout.

It tightens the facial muscles and creates a serious, angry expression. and said

“What did your father say?”

"Your father said he was an ally of the robes."

Whoo!

Orland pointed his wand at Zich. A little bit of magic permeated the staff. But Orland's was nothing but acting.

“Cover your horse! Your father is the master of Snouwick!”

“That is no proof that the person is not a collaborator.”

“This child… !”

Push the cane even further. But he never used magic. And I expected Zich to keep talking.

“It’s not just Wilwes Dwayne. There doesn't seem to be a direct line with the robes, but I think Wayne Jaywick isn't influenced by Willwes Dwayne either. Other than that, the families of other high-ranking magicians are also suspicious.”

Here, Orland felt a little bit of a sense of crisis. His investigation was quite accurate.

Of course, the culprit was completely wrong.

Orland bit his lip. I pretended I couldn't win in minutes and shook the ball.

Jack was amazed. Although he was not as good as himself, Orland's acting was quite good.

“Okay, tell me everything you want to say. Listen to how nonsense you are!”

"great. Then let’s talk about each one.”

Zich kept his mouth shut, as if to put together something to say for a moment. The time was not very long.

Zich spoke again.

“The first thing that struck me was when Jack Ma, out of jealousy, hired mercenaries to kill us. At that time, I saw some traces of the robes.”

“What marks?”

“They have their own unique skills. It’s a mixture of alcohol and alcohol, but if you’re a magician, you wouldn’t know it.”

'So don't question it. At least it's a setting that has nothing to do with you.' As Zich thought, Orland was nervous for a while whether the trace might also be attached to him, but after listening to Zich's words, Orland loosened it.

'Is there such a thing?'

I just thought about it for a moment. But Orland, who knew that the robes had a lot to do with Ma's hiring of mercenaries, sounded plausible to Zich.

“Let’s keep talking. That's why I tortured Jack Ma with a little bit of force. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have made it that far."

“What did you find out?”

“I found out that Jack Ma was being helped by some strange 'friends'.”

“They said they were robes.”

“I think so. So I started investigating in earnest. Of course, they arrested me right away on the Jawick Street, but I ordered my servants to protect Elena secretly. Because I thought there was a high chance they were going to target Elena.”

“And you saved Elena from being kidnapped?”

"That's right. Of course, I was sorry that I didn't send Elena back right away, but I wanted to think of the people who targeted Elena. I must have been very upset, so I thought there was going to be a movement.”

“So you kidnapped me and offered to help save Elena? To check the enemy’s movements?”

"That's right. Oh, I also sent the blackmail to the meeting. I'm hoping for a response from my fellow robes."

“You are daring.”

Orland, who had paid considerable attention to the letter at the time, secretly wiped away a cold sweat.

I thought I was sending it to myself, but I didn't know that the person who sent the letter was looking for people right next to me.

“The first thing I suspected was Wayne Jawick. We have a direct grudge relationship with us and Elena, and I don't know if it's intentional or not, but I said let's put the Rob group on hold for now. But I wasn't sure. It seemed that the situation was heading towards a confrontation between the Dwayne and the Jaewick. It is possible that that was the intention of the enemies.”

Orland nodded. And inside, the enemy was surprised. Zich knew exactly what the situation was.

“But when I entered Jawick Street, I saw a strange sight. You, your father, and Wayne Jawick talking on the Jawick.”

“What kind of strange sight is that?”

“To be precise, it felt like Wayne Jawick was thinking of Will Wes Dwayne.”

Orland knew what that meant. Didn't Wayne Jawick intentionally give off a little bit of a nuance as if he was Willwes?

That's why Wayne Jawick kept talking to his father.

“I felt it then. Elena was kidnapped from her home so easily, and I wonder if you, Dwayne, were involved in this.”

“I am not.”

"I know."

Zich looked at Orland with trustful eyes. It was the kind of eyes that would make Leila shake her head and turn her head if she saw it.

“All that is left is your father, and that raises the question. Why would he want to clash his family with his collaborators, the Zawick family? However, it is possible to guess from past actions. At the height of the Dwayne's and the Zawick's conflict, your father was the Dwayne's head, yet he was neutral. It’s because of the fact that he’s a mato.”

“It was an attitude that could be taken as a mate.”

"That said I. But what if you were thinking that if your father has taken a neutral attitude, as in that case, own the deuweinga and re-valent week conflict that never caught? "

“•••What do you want to say?”

“In other words, a clash between two families could actually be a clash between the Jawic and you and your daughter. And perhaps the target is you or both you and your daughter.”

"gibberish!"

Orland said harshly. But inside, I wanted to laugh as if my mouth was going to tear. Because Zich perfectly followed the scenario he had crafted.

But the mouth moved differently.

“Your father is plotting a plot against me and Elena? Even if I don't have a good relationship with my father, would my father do such a thing?"

“If you don’t believe it, you and Elena will suffer.”

Zich continued to speak out his arguments calmly.

“Evidence? There's evidence, so you'll be flirting!"

“But I can’t reveal it.”

Of course, there was no evidence.

“Did you think I would believe that?”

“But what will happen in the future is predictable. How about using that as evidence?”

“•••Can you predict what will happen?”

“Based on the evidence I have, it is certain that it will happen. So I think that if things go on similar to what I said, trust will be gained to some extent.”

Orland rolls his eyes. He seemed to be very troubled by the fact that he did not reveal the meaning of refusal.

'What are you worrying about, you idiot!'

He had a serious expression on his face, but he booed inwardly.

'Don't roll your head and ask for the bait. After all, the robes were annihilated anyway, so your plans are mostly messed up, right? Here's a guy from Carwiman's honorary paladin with an awesome background who's on your side. So, how much can you modify your good-looking plan?'

Zich was thinking that Orland's plan was to frame Wilwess and expel him, and make him head of the village.

If Orland really had such a conspiracy, then Zich's offer to work together would have been very sweet.

"•••great. I was deceived at least once when I saw the tokens you showed for Carwiman's Honorable Knights, whether they were real or fake."

"thank you so much."

Jack bowed his head.

Orland took the wand.

“Then what will happen next?”

Zich explained to Orland. Orlando nodded.

"go. And come back in a few days. Then you decide whether to trust you or not.”

"all right."

Zich put his foot on the window sill. It was probably like he came in through the window when he came in.

“Let me ask you one thing.”

“What?”

Zich turned his head.

“Why did you show Elena the fake token?”

“Because of the robes. The relationship between the robes and the Carwiman is very bad. It's possible that the robes' allies are aware of that fact. because it was hidden. I don't really need to think that I'm after them because I'm Kar Woman's honorary paladin."

Of course not. Zich completely hid his identity to create an environment that would strike Orland in the back of the head.

Zich said as he turned his head and looked out the window.

“A sword can only use its power when it suddenly springs out.”

And jumped out the window.

Orlando watched silently out the window as Zich turned into a black shadow and disappeared out of the mansion in an instant.

widely!

Closed the window. And he vomited a small amount of unbearable cheers.

“Good!”

After dying, I found a guy much more useful than the robes.

'I'm sure he'll be an honorary knight of Carwiman!'

With his help, who pinpointed Wilwes as the culprit, the plan is nothing.

It will be easier to pretend.

'This is not the time to be like this!'

Orland moved to a plan.

* * *

Zich returned to their new hideout. Snok dug a cave in a nearby mountain, and thanks to the power of the earth's redemption, the hideout was quite cozy, not like a cave.

Divide the greeting party Siegfried enters the party room of God (?) Lay on the blanket. And hijuk hijuk laughed.

'You'll have to roll to death, Orland Dwayne.'

The future Zich told Orland about is not much. I didn't make a prediction. I don't think that's actually going to happen.

'If only I hadn't spoken to Orland.'

If Zich's plans work out, Orland will have to work to make the future Zeek talked about a reality.

Only then will there be a justification to believe Zich's words, so that a person with the status of an honorary knight of Carwiman can be a companion. While also avoiding doubts about himself.

And in the future, there will be a situation where Orland is trying to win the trust of Orland, not the situation where Zee is trying to win Orland's trust.

'I have to control the situation while digging for information in the meantime.'

If successful, Orland will become Zich's perfect puppet.

A few days later, Zich sneaked back into Orland's room. This time Orland was already waiting in the room.

“I have seen you in the Temple of Carwiman.”

“What?”

“They said it was an honor paladin.”

“This will increase the credibility of my horse.”

Not long ago, Zich made a request to Carwiman's temple in this city.

Deny others about your identity, but only tell the truth about Orland. At the request of the honorary paladin, the highest priest of the temple readily nodded.

“Certainly more reliable than before.”

“Then what happened to my prediction?”

“It was all right.”

Orland said seriously.

“Some of the families of Matap rebelled against my father.”

“What did I say? Did you say that the family associated with Rob would definitely rebel?”

“But why to my father? both are the same

Wasn't it on your side?"

“It’s definitely going to be a tough day. Anyway, will you keep your promise to cooperate with me in the future?”

“It’s not completely believable yet, but if things go this far, there’s no reason not to believe it.”

Orland sighed.

“I believe.”

“You thought well.”

Zich nodded with a smile on his face. And I thought.

'Now, what kind of future should we guess?' If that's a future that can hit Wilwes in any future, Orland will do it for the most part. For Zich's trust and his own plans.

' 👑! I feel like I got a fairy that makes my wish come true.'

Seeing Orland acting with a troubled expression on his face, Zich grinned inwardly.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 265 Tuesday

It was good to save Elena, but after that, Wilwes had no choice but to fall into a very difficult situation.

He had mobilized too much of the city's power to save Elena.

Of course, the reason for such a noisy mobilization of the troops was that they had a strong intention to attack Zich and the others at once rather than to save Elena, but as that failed, their intention was bound to fade. Due to the nature of the city of horseshoes, the person in the highest position in this city was obviously Wilwes, the owner of the towers, but there were mayors and bureaucrats in Snoowick like other cities, and they could not treat even Wilwes recklessly.

However, this time as a group, he caused a conflict with them.

Wilwes had no regrets and would have made the same choice again if faced with the same situation, but it was also true that the situation was troublesome.

However, during this difficult time, some of the magicians of the Tower rebelled against Wilwes. They weren't just magicians. They came from a prestigious family and participated in the Supreme Council of Mato.

Of course, they weren't in any coup d'état. They just saw Wilwes and asked him to step down from the position of Ma Thapju. But usually, if you can ignore that opinion enough, now the narrow political base is a significant blow tormented Will Lewis.

Usually, Wilwes takes over the position of the master of the tower to the best wizard, but this does not guarantee a permanent position.

As Matoap was a group that gathered for the benefit of wizards, the master of Matoap, who caused great damage to the profits of Matoap, was often kicked out.

Those who now rebel claim that Wilwes's actions caused great damage to the tower.

So now, the public opinion of the matoap was split in two.

First of all, the mainstream public opinion was that it would not be enough to kick Wilwes out no matter how big the incident was, but there was also a reaction that he should be held accountable.

Originally, the dissatisfaction had faded away from the surface, but the dissatisfaction was definitely brought out into people's eyes by those who rebelled.

“This is the situation in the tower right now.”

As they seem to have entered into a cooperative relationship, Orland explained the current situation of the tower in detail to Sieg.

Zich listened to him quite eagerly, as if he believed that trust would return as much as his attitude.

However, neither of them had the slightest desire to hold each other's hands and go on the right path. I just want to use my opponent.

“However, no matter how bad the situation is now, my father's power and influence are still quite high. It will not be easy to attack from the outside.”

Saying that, Orland glanced at Zich.

The reason Zich, who has the status of Carwiman's honorary paladin, asked Orland for help was probably because Wilwes also had a powerful status as the matopse. At least Orland thought so.

Therefore, if it was determined that Wilwes' authority and influence had collapsed, Zich could act independently, thinking that Orland himself was no longer needed.

it had to be stopped

'Of course, the other masters in the tower also know that the robes, to be precise, are related to me, so they won't break cooperation easily.'

“You are right.”

Zich agreed with Orland.

“You really understand the situation. I chose you as a collaborator because I knew Wilwes Dwayne so well that I was young enough to participate in the supreme council of the tower, but I don't think there's anything wrong with my decision. It’s nice to hold hands with you.” After praising Orland for a while, Zich seriously changed his expression.

“I can’t move hastily as you say. Besides, things are a little weird right now.”

"Strange? Where are you talking?”

“Didn’t you say there were three rebels, including Wayne Jawick, among the magicians who had the right to participate in the Supreme Council?”

"exactly."

“I know there is more than that from the information I have, but only three have come out.”

"•••exactly?"

"That's right. Maybe the enemy is hiding his power just in case?”

“It may not be.”

He replied calmly, but Orland was terrified.

There were certainly a few more families he could influence. I just didn't put forward the situation this time in preparation for what Ziek said.

“It is, too.”

As Zich seemed to pass quietly, Orland was relieved. But the next time he heard Zich's small mumble, he couldn't help but be surprised.

“I don’t think the evidence I got was wrong. If so, you may have to restart the investigation from the origin... .”

The sound that Zich restarts the investigation from the beginning is that even Zich's gaze, which sees Willwes as the culprit and Orland as a collaborator, returns to the origin.

'Then I will come back as a suspect again.'

In fact, didn't Zich say that he saw Orland himself as a prime suspect before he was convinced that Wilwes was the culprit? In the past, Zich would have sneered at the fact that he saw him as a suspect, but now it is different.

'It's a specification to be hostile to Carwiman.'

If Zich sees himself as a suspect, his current advantage will disappear and he will rather be in Wilwes's position.

'Damn, I have no choice but to mobilize other guys.'

The problem is that Zich doesn't know how many of his collaborators he has. I asked a little question, but Zich shook his head, saying he couldn't tell.

'If he mobilizes less than the collaborators he knows, he may doubt the evidence he has and try to re-investigate.'

So, it doesn't matter if you mobilize more than Zich has figured out, but you can't mobilize less. But we don't know how much information Zich knows.

'I can't help it. We have no choice but to mobilize all our partners.'

It was a dangerous situation, but now that the robes have been wiped out, I couldn't let Zich go as an excuse to drive Wilwes down. And I couldn't even make him suspicious.

Zich looked at Orland, who was counting ping-pings in his head.

'Yeah, mobilize everything. I'm afraid I'll see all the cards you have.'

This time, he was able to identify some of Orland's allies by culling those who opposed Wilwess, but Zich didn't believe that was all there was to it.

'Because there's no way someone like you can lay all the cards in the beginning.'

But now Orland will have no choice but to reveal all of his hand.

'Come on, move, my friend. How are you going to live without my trust in this messed up plan? Shouldn't you win my trust? Move hard so that I do not question myself about the fake evidence that I only talk about and re-investigate.'

Zich opened his mouth after giving Orland enough time to ponder his concerns.

“Then, shall we end today's meeting? Let's wait a few more days. Because other collaborators might come face to face.”

“••• Got it.”

I want to make an impression, but I can't in front of Zich. Orland pretended to be Taeyeon.

“Oh, by the way. Do you have any idea why your father is after you and Elena?”

“… My father hasn't decided yet."

“I understand your feelings, but I also have to take at least one clue. It’s just a good home.”

Zich asked with a serious expression. and said inwardly.

'Yes, tell me. The cause you invented, Willwes, is aiming for you and Elena.'

“•.•If I had to ask… .” Orland cautiously opened his mouth.

“Maybe it’s because I and Elena are embarrassed.”

“Are you embarrassed?”

“What is your image of your father?”

“As a wizard, it was very scary. I don’t know much about the aspect of being a mage master, and other than that, I received the image of a grandfather who cherishes and loves his granddaughter Elena.”

“Did you?”

There was something bitter in Orland's tone.

'It's smoke... is not it?'

With a fairly sincere expression on his face, Zich tilted his head. It was all sincerity, or even if it was mixed with acting, he judged that his sincerity was mixed to some extent.

“When I was young, my father wasn't like he is now. In a way, he had a personality similar to the way he is now Mr. Wayne Jawick, who is cold-hearted and judges everything as a magical achievement.”

This was pretty surprising information.

“My father now cares for and loves Elena, who cannot use magic, and tries to somehow create a happy future, but when I was young, it wasn’t like that. Not as good as Elena, but my magic achievements were very low back then. And to my father at the time, I was an object of shame.”

“•••Considering the personality of that person now, I can't imagine it.”

“I fully understand. To be honest, I never thought my father could change like that.”

Orland sighed deeply.

“These are famous stories. If you ask some older people in the city, everyone will know. When I was young, I hated my father so much, and that's why I switched to my wife's school. And it is also the reason why I have a difficult relationship with my father even now.”

“It happened.”

“If my father was really the conspirator and he had us as the object of the conspiracy, then there is probably a great reason. Even though the exterior may have changed, the inside has not changed at all.”

“It must have been difficult, but thank you for talking about it.”

“As I said earlier, this is a famous story in the city. Besides, I still believe that my father isn't really in darkness. No matter how bad the past was, he was my father.”

“I sincerely hope so.”

“Thank you.”

'That's the cause.'

That I would not think jeonbuil make at least Will Lewis as waste oil from  would be one.

'Seeing that you are so confident, I don't think it's a lie. That inspiration wasn't great when I was younger.'

He felt a sense of disparity between the demon king he had experienced and Willus Dwayne now, but it seems that part of it existed in the past.

“Then I will go now. Previously… .”

Zich rummaged through his pockets. There he took out a piece of paper.

“Can you analyze this for me?”

“What is this?”

Orland opened the paper. There was something written on it that I did not know whether it was a letter or an unusual picture. It is not a commonly used article in the market. But Orland was surprised. It was very familiar to him.

'Password I sent?'

It was obviously the code Orland and Robes used to give orders to their allies. But it was in Zich's grasp.

“I got it by accident when I hid in the old Jawick family. It looks like a password, can you crack it?”

"This… Interesting.”

Orland swiped the paper in admiration. However, unlike his relaxed gesture, his mind quickly returned.

I found out how this got into Zich's hands. As it turns out, he couldn't crack this code. Moreover, even if it is decrypted, the password does not contain any information that could be suspicious of itself.

In other words, even if he is holding the password, there is no risk.

The reason Orland was worried now was thinking about which one would be more advantageous to him: breaking the password or taking it off because he didn't know it.

“If you can crack this code to reveal their plans, it might be easier to uncover their identity.”

A thought suddenly popped into Orland's head as he heard Zich's words.

'Can't we control this guy with a passphrase?'

After all, it is oneself who uses this ciphertext to give orders.

After sending a ciphertext of a suitable incident to someone of the collaborator, when Zich steals it, he pretends to decrypt it himself.

And if you pretend to be advice and guide his thinking appropriately... .

“Let’s try it.”

"thank you."

Jack bowed his head. which

His heart was far from grateful.

'okay. Lyla is struggling to solve this, so give me some clues.'

An ancient imperial character that can reveal the reality of the ancient empire. I couldn't just pass by the person who had the clue in front of me.

In that way, the ridiculous skits continued, which would be more than funny if someone ignorant of the situation saw it and would be disappointed.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 266 screen

The confusion in the tower, which I thought would subside to some extent as time went by, got worse as time went on.

More and more people are calling for Wilwes to step down.

It was also one of the magicians who had the right to participate in the Supreme Council of the Tower, and although they were a bit inferior to that, they were from a prestigious family and were competent enough.

The tower was completely split in two. There were still a large number of supporters of Willwes, but the opposition could not be ignored either.

Whether he believed in the growing power, the attack on Willwes became stronger and more radical. Shouts came and went even at the Supreme Council held to settle the confusion.

“This is the current situation.”

Orland said to Zich. The slightly distorted wrinkles on his forehead were telling him that he was also in a lot of trouble.

And Zich's expression wasn't very good.

“It’s strange. No matter how close they were to each other, the attack on Matap Ju was over the limit. At this level, I don’t think there will be any benefit to each other.”

'That's what I mean!'

Orland screamed inwardly. I wanted to grab Zich by the neck and shake him right away.

It was Orland who created this situation, but he only followed Zich's advice. According to the evidence he obtained, Zich said that the future would be like that.

'What kind of proof, damn it!'

Now, I was genuinely curious as to what the evidence was.

If it hadn't been for the deaths of allies and Zich's Carwiman's honorary paladin status, Robra would have killed him right away.

But Orland couldn't let go of the string Zich.

It seems that Zich is in trouble. His mouth twitched, and Orland clenched his teeth as if forcing himself to swallow the rising swearing again.

He wasn't speaking out loud, but the shape of Zich's mouth was clearly muttering evidence.

'I don't know what it is, but I can't be suspicious of the evidence.'

"maybe… .”

Orland opened his mouth and Zich looked at him.

“Are you aware of their intentions?”

“I was just guessing.”

This is the intention that he created by rolling his head to give Zich a plausible reason. Zich looked at him with twinkling eyes.

“You are truly amazing. It was no coincidence that I was able to attend the supreme meeting of the Mato at such a young age.”

Zich is very admirable. But the inside was completely different.

'Okay, let's hear about your plans.'

I thought about it for a while, but basically, what Zich told Orland about the future was just a story he had just thrown away.

A story that seems like an absurdity. But Zich didn't care.

'That's the story, this guy will fit in properly.'

Zich giggled as he imagined Orland sweating profusely, trying to figure out why.

Orland, unaware of Zich's heart, was relieved. Still, the honorary paladin of Carwiman does not respect himself. It may be helpful now, of course, in the future.

Orland said in a friendly tone.

“I don’t think it was a friendly coup.”

“You mean the friendly coup?”

"exactly. For that reason, I suspect that the purpose is to thin out the people who are currently dissatisfied with Ma Thapju. In fact, after the incident, there are definitely people who show their sympathy for the people who protest against Ma Thapju.”

“Even if it’s not the people who have joined hands with Ma Thap-ju.”

"exactly. Surely, I dare to think that my father was a very good person as a matap master. Prior to this incident, he hadn't even caused anything that could be conspicuously reproachable. But there are always those who are dissatisfied.”

“It’s like you’re thinning out people like that.”

“At the same time, he might be thinking of tying up other powerful families and wizards into the plot. The more they disappear, the stronger the power and authority of the matap master.”

“And the final step… .”

"exactly. A friendly coup.”

Although it was made in a hurry, Orland was quite satisfied with the plan.

Later, when he pulled out one of the plans to expel Wilwes and gave it a reason, a plausible conspiracy emerged.

“Well, there is definitely a possibility.”

'Then let's go for a friend's coup.'

As if picking things up on the market floor, he decided the direction of the conspiracy to take place.

It was such an absurd moment, but no one knew whether it was fortunate or unfortunate. Orland in front of him didn't even notice.

“Nevertheless, the more evidence, the better, so I will continue to break into the house that seems to be cooperating with Ma Thap-ju. I don't know if I'll ever get another passphrase."

'So spend a lot. Understand?' As Zich intended, Orland thought it would be necessary to increase the amount of ciphertext sent to his collaborators. Of course, that was the reason he wanted to increase the credibility of the coup he was talking about.

“It must be possible because Mr. Dwayne can crack the code. I didn't know Mr. Dwayne could crack the code."

“I didn’t even know that the characters I knew would pop out.”

Orland eventually revealed the ciphertext to Zich. Of course, I didn't tell you everything. To the extent that it is said that it is at a level that can be deciphered if it takes a certain amount of time. But Orlando or Zich, that was enough.

What they want from each other is markedly different.

“What ancient language is it from?”

"exactly. I'm also quite curious about the language side. I didn't know that the research I was doing as a hobby would be helpful at times like this.”

I was a little uneasy if I could tell you the password the robes gave me, but now is not the time to hide.

'It's their responsibility to fail and die at will.' Orland very neatly shifted the blame to Rob Bgnomes.

“But I’m also a researcher, so I don’t know everything. It can’t be helped that it takes time.”

I have no intention of teaching Zich all the passwords. I didn't feel the need to do that, and I needed a part that was taking the lead.

Fortunately, Zich didn't pay much attention to crypto. However, he did not leave it all to Orland.

“My colleague, Lyla, is also working on the cipher. He also admires Mr. Dwayne's knowledge.”

“I am ashamed. I will do my best to set an example for talented juniors.”

Conversation as if for each other. But the essence was very different.

'Lyra is also doing research on passwords, so don't play tricks like telling fake passwords.'

That was the intention of Zich's words. Of course, I couldn't understand the hidden meaning of Orlando Denny Zeek's words, who didn't know the inside of Zich's sword. But there was enough awareness.

'I can't do such a clumsy operation.'

So Orland's thinking steadily moved according to Zich's intention.

“I am happy though. Dwayne has been of such great help. In fact, I really doubted Mr. Dwayne's willingness to cooperate with a large-scale investigation into Matthew's State. You are probably going to be a father.”

“I will do my best to help, but please don’t get me wrong.”

Orland said in a firm voice.

“I still believe in my father, and I will not stop believing in him until the moment when his sins are revealed. I won't even let you down.”

It is a scene that can be thought of as a resolute but sad faith of a child who has a fond and deep affection for his father. In fact, Orland's expression was very determined.

Zich nodded meekly.

'You must be awkward.'

and groaned inwardly.


As soon as Zich returned to his dormitory, he put his head down on a table full of documents and books and handed a few notes to Laila, who was writing something diligently.

“Today’s password.”

"thanks."

Lila took the note and placed it next to the piece of paper she was writing on.

“Are you okay?”

“At least it’s much better than it was when there were no clues like it was a while ago.”

Lyla put the pen down and stretched out. I straightened my body, which had been stumbling a little, and turned the chair around.

“Are you going to rest?”

"little. After playing with the pen all day today, my body stiffened. It looks like my eyes are a little blurry.”

Exaggerately turn your shoulders and press the area next to your eyes.

“Take it easy. The password is not so urgent. If you don't have a clue, I don't know, but you already have a clue, right?"

“I’m taking it easy. There's nothing to do for the time being anyway, well. The reason I came to Snoowick in the first place was also to ask if there was anything helpful in cracking the password.”

'I saw that.'

The reason I came to Snoowick in the first place was to find information about the ancient Empire, Cloone, and its characters.

'I had so many things to do that I forgot everything.'

In a way, I didn't even know that Lyla was the only one who was faithful to the purpose of coming to this city.

“Is the plan going well?”

Lyla asked.

"okay. It's going to be a climax soon. At that time, the Orlander climbed all the way to the top... .”

Zich raised his hand high in line with his words, and then lowered it down the hook.

“It will keep falling.”

“••• Try not to harm others as much as possible.”

"do not worry. I have it engraved on my head.”

But looking at Zich's smiling face, it doesn't sound very reliable.

“Ah, the bad guys are of course excluded, right?”

Even more so when you say things like that.

Lila grabbed her head slightly and nodded.

Even if he did, he was trusting because he wouldn't really touch innocent people. Of course, if you are guilty and become a target for Zich, it won't be a bad thing.

Having had enough rest, Lyla turned her chair back to crack the code.

“Are there any results?”

“To some extent. Still, the more clues there are, the faster the work will be.”

“Don’t worry about that. I will continue to bring it to you in the future.”

As long as Orland continues to send passwords, the number of clues will steadily increase.

“Okay then.”

Lyla waved her hands as if to get out, but Zich kept her head straight and looked at what she was doing. Leila didn't say anything.

“Is that the rubbing from the ancient ruins of Violwin?”

"Huh. Because I think you'll find the most useful information here. But I don't know if there really is any useful information. you have to be lucky I didn't cut out all the rubbing because I ran out of paper. I didn't know which part was important, so it popped up sporadically."

But Lila wasn't expecting much. First of all, the amount of rubbing was too small compared to the overall text.

'Be sure to bring more later.'

I had to somehow seduce Zich and go there again.

“Yeah, good job.”

Zich left Lyla's room, apparently losing interest. Without even raising her head, she shook her hand roughly upwards, and then Laila dug into the text again.

Not long after her efforts were in vain, Lila was able to interpret a passage.

But only one verse. I don't know what that means.

'Maybe I misinterpreted it.'

Is it a phrase that corresponds to a taboo for an event? But Lyla stopped thinking any further. A clue that could decipher the fortress text came in and it was quite overworked, so his head and body were creaking quite a bit.

'Should I take a break?'

She stopped working. Blow out the lit candle.

Before the light went out, the candle did her last to illuminate the passage she had interpreted.

[Never use too much.]

(Continued on next page)

Zich diligently toured the prestigious families who led this chaos.

The boundaries of the Jira family, the atmosphere surrounding the city, were quite severe, but they could not stop Sieg.

In addition, Zich did not travel much to important places in the family, such as the office of the state of California.

The place he was aiming for was the Jeonseo-gu room or the butler's room where important letters from the family gather for a while.

He was able to collect a bunch of ciphertexts there.

'If this is enough, Lyla's work will progress a lot.'

I heard that she had some small achievements.

Even though Zich didn't know what the phrase Lyla was talking about, anyway, just extracting a meaningful phrase from an array of strange letters or symbols was a feat that would have been well received.

The plot that wrapped around the chopping board while Zich ran on his feet and Lyla sat down to spend time was steadily progressing.

And finally that day has come.

“An execution date has been set.”

Orland handed Zich a note. There were letters written in rough handwriting as if they were scattered. it was the date

“Three days later.”

“I interpreted what was written in the cipher text you brought.”

“Do you mean the date on which the pro-Western coup will take place?”

"exactly. Exactly three days later, by coincidence , the plenary meeting was decided in the tower.”

“It’s such a great coincidence.”

“A great coincidence.”

Zich and Orland looked at each other and smiled meaningfully. It looked like the scene of a scoundrel plotting a dirty conspiracy.

It wasn't even a mistake.

“I think it’s different from the Supreme Meeting.”

“Literally, it is a meeting where all wizards who want to have some degree of reputation in the tower gather. It seems that tomorrow, after hearing everyone's opinions, and negotiating a compromise, we are going to end this situation altogether.” “Of course, the reality will be different, right?” “How would you like it? If you detain all the people there, you will capture most of the city's high-ranking people.”

“However, no matter how strong the authority of the matap master, this city also has mayors and other bureaucrats.”

“It seems that the mayor will also be attending the meeting. Other high-ranking officials as well.”

“The prey that are very tasty will be gathered in one place.”

“There will be no special feast for Jinjin.”

“So how did you do it? Did you put a magic trap there and make it explode?”

“If that happens, even those who started the coup will not all explode. Conspiring wizards, including Wayne Jawick, will join us for now.”

“I wish I could, please. Wouldn’t it be great if only the conspirators were selected and killed?”

“I agree.”

Did Zich's words directly hit his taste? Orland chuckled.

“But such a just and pleasant

There's no way these guys can lay traps for you. won't even be able to. I'm going to imprison everyone there."

“You don’t seem to want to go all the way.”

'Good luck. If it all blew up, I had no choice but to use my hands.'

There was also Lyla's request, so I didn't want to see more blood.

If Orland had devised a plot to kill them right away, he would have devised a plan, but for the time being, it seemed that it would be ok to watch Orland's show with both hands.

“I don’t know. When you say imprisoned, you mean that you are holding the lifeline of the other person. If it's rude, doesn't like it, or gets in the way, there's a chance I'll kill you without hesitation."

“I don’t know what to do with these people. No matter how powerful the tower and city were, the country would not stand still.”

Snoowick is not a city-state, nor is it bordered by any other country.

If the country does not recognize this coup d'etat, the subjugation squad will come immediately. Even if the power of the Amur Tower is strong, it is not enough to cover the power of the state.

Besides, it is obvious that the power will be down due to the coup d'etat.

“It won’t be obvious. I'll make a cause For a reason they must do this. if not… .”

Orland lowered his voice, as if trying to hide an important secret.

“I don’t even know if I’m literally trying to put the blame on the other side.”

“And perhaps the one who is going to put the blame on is the horseman.”

Orland frowned.

“… It is possible that your father is being used without knowing anything.”

"Sure. I have no desire to meddle in your beliefs.”

Jack said with a smile.

“But I know you're the one who strictly separates public and private. I believe that personal affection will not distort the plan.”

“•••It will never happen.”

Orland, who had shown how well Jig and Kungjjak fit together so far, said with a very unpleasant voice as far as now.

“If you stop the conspiracy and dig up the whole story, your father will surely be acquitted. I am sure.”

“I hope that Mr. Dwayne’s wishes come true.”

'Of course Wilwes Dwayne will be acquitted. That's definitely not what you want.'

Jack smirked to himself. But Orland doesn't know what Zich is.

“Thank you.”

With a stiff expression on his face, Orlando responded by acting like that.

“Oh, come to think of it, I have a favor to ask of you.”

“What is your request?”

“Will you not protect Elena?”

“Elena?”

“Elena will also come to the general meeting.”

She is not a famous wizard.

The family has produced great wizards from generation to generation, including Wilwes Dwayne, who is still in charge of the mage, and two wizards with the right to attend the Supreme Council are among the most prestigious.

But she doesn't even have magical powers, so she doesn't have the right to participate in the whole meeting.

Then there is only one possibility left.

“As a reference in this case.”

"exactly. Everyone else is also dangerous, but Elena, who can't protect herself, is even more so. I'm not saying to protect it from the beginning. You who are wanted right now can't do that. In the midst of a commotion, when a coup d'état takes place in earnest, watch the situation and protect the child.” Zich looked at Orland. Is that really true? Is it an act of infidelity towards her daughter? if not… .

'Is it to protect Elena De Wayne, who still has value in use?'

“•••Why are you looking at me like that? Is it difficult?”

Orland looked at Zich, who didn't answer right away, questioningly. Zich nodded.

“Elena is a disciple of my close friend. Although intrigues and misunderstandings have made our relationship now bizarre, I and Lyla still love Elena. Of course you have to protect it. Besides, I am the one who said that Matap Master was targeting you and Elena. You have to take full responsibility.”

“Thank you. If you can't excuse me for that, can't you mobilize Ms. Lyla and your servant to protect Elena? I say this, but in the worst case scenario, Elena will be the only family left for me. It seems like I'm only satisfying my greed in front of a big situation, so it's a shame, but it's the request of my life."

There was an expression of anguish on the part of the father who didn't want to suspect Wilwes, but couldn't believe it completely, so he wanted to keep his daughter alive.

It is an expression that is enough to feel sorry for other people.

But Zich had already felt no emotion in Orland's expression. He just calmly analyzes the hidden meaning of Orland's words.

'Hmm. They want me out of the operation.'

Apparently, he was swayed by Zich's predictions based on unfounded evidence, so at least he seemed to want to end the curtain on his own in the end.

'Well, okay. Let's see how far we can dance.'

"great. They all mobilize.”

Jack nodded his head.

“Thank you.”

Orland bowed his head.

“But please know that if things go wrong, I will have no choice but to participate.”

“Of course.”

Orland knew it would be unreasonable to ask for more, so he nodded.

And as time passed, the day came for the general meeting in the tower.

The sun rises above the horizon in the distance. Lost in the magic of the night, the world that had been sleeping in silence begins to stretch.

Many people and creatures started the day and the world began to come alive.

but one place. Only around the horse tower, which can be seen everywhere in Snoowick, the refreshing energy did not dare to spread the spirit. Rather, a heavy atmosphere that seemed to have been suppressed was spread everywhere.

It's not that there aren't people. Rather, the surrounding area of ​​the tower was more crowded than at other times. However, everyone in the tower kept their mouths shut in tension.

One by one people get off the wagons. All of them are wizards who make a name for themselves in the tower.

Most of them are confined to their own labs and live in a rough way when it comes to eating and washing, but today was different.

I went home, slept well, and ate a good meal. Instead of a squiggly robe, he wore a well-maintained robe, his wand was clean, and his hair and beards were well-groomed.

Even wizards who were only interested in research on a regular basis knew that the situation in which the Magic Tower was running right now was not unusual.

At that moment, a carriage stopped in front of the horse tower. People around them checked the carriage's coat of arms and stopped their gaze.

quiver

The carriage door opened and a man got out. The moment he saw him, the people around him screamed.

He noticed the commotion, but he didn't look away. I just glanced at the village tower once again.

As always, a large tower that dignifies into the sky. He was very familiar with the tower even before he was mature, but why? Today, it seemed a little different from the usual horse tower.

He, Wayne Jawick, looked down at the entrance to the Ma Tower.

The entrance to the tower was wide open. People inside look at him. There were all kinds of emotions in his eyes. Positive, negative, jealous, confused, contemptuous, even fearful.

It was a feeling I sent to the one who was at the forefront of those who now threw the tower into chaos.

But he silently endured those gazes.

Jerk!

took one step At the same time, he once again grabbed his heart.

'No matter what the outcome is, something big happens today.'

And he had no intention of becoming a loser. The eyes are forward, the chin is high, the mouth is firm, and the steps are natural.

In order to gain higher power in the future, he stepped into the battlefield that unfolded in the future.

The place was quite spacious. If the supreme meeting is held on the top floor of the tower, the space of the master, the general meeting will be held in the center of the tower.

The entire conference hall made by expanding the entire space on the 2nd and 3rd floors was very large. This was because it was a space created for various events in the tower where a large number of people had no choice but to gather.

It was like a large lecture hall or stage. It was a form of creating a lecture space under one side and cascading chairs around it.

Already, many people were sitting in chairs exchanging opinions with each other.

Like Wayne Jawick, the majors of this semi-annual were seated early in the front row. And the other wizards sat in groups of acquaintances.

On one side was Elena with anxious eyes.

The moment I thought the meeting room was filled with people to some extent.

Wilwes Dwayne entered. For a moment, the conference hall fell into silence.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 268 screen

The meeting started. The murmur disappeared and all eyes turned to the central pulpit.

Occasionally, there were people who glanced at the front seat. It was where the magicians who had the right to participate in the supreme meeting with the matap master and Elena sat.

Snuwick's mayor and high-ranking bureaucracy were also involved.

There was one person standing in the pulpit. He was the moderator for this meeting.

He cleared his voice a few times, then aloud and briefly explained why the meeting was held. And then I called Wayne Jawick.

A person who can be said to be the main role of the chaos that is now wrapped around the tower. He wanted to hear what he was saying first.

Wayne walked to the pulpit. There was no hesitation in his steps as he had already shaken off all delusions and worries before entering the tower.

His gaze passed through Orland, who frowned heavily, and Elena, who stiffened with tension, to Wilwes, who was staring at him indifferently.

Their eyes met for a moment. But Wayne soon looked away. Then, looking straight ahead, he met a lot of eyes staring straight at him.

and opened his mouth.

* * *

that time. Zich and his party had entered the city. All four were wanted, but the city was chaotic, so people didn't pay any attention to them even in light disguise.

Only Laila, who had a hard time disguising because of her non-human beauty, only lightly covered her face with two hoodies.

However, it was definitely dangerous to walk around openly, so the other three waited in a sparsely populated area, and Siegman monitored the tower alone.

'It's starting.'

Zich narrowed his eyes. A group of people can be seen entering the tower. They were all wearing robes and holding wands, but they couldn't fool Zich's eyes.

They obviously had more to do with physical work than with magic. whether it be force or labor.

'Certainly, those people must have been mobilized by the coup forces, including the Jawick family. He doesn't seem like a mercenary. For servants who just do work, the body is in balance.'

Jack could be sure.

'I was raising them secretly.'

Perhaps something like this had been planned for a long time.

'The robes must have helped me raise it. Perhaps Orland is holding the proof of raising them.'

It certainly looked like a lot of effort was put into the robes' other plans I've seen so far.

'Is it because we have to make friends of the future demon king and hero?'

Jack smiled brightly. The more carefully the tea is produced, the better it is crushed.

The coup d'état forces entered the tower without any obstruction. It seemed that those who were leading the group at the forefront were the magicians belonging to the school to which the Jae Week family belonged.

They waited for a while in the lobby of the tower. I could see the wizard who had led the group talking loudly.

'It's not important.'

As I listened carefully, it was a criticism of Wilwes. But Zich didn't see much of a meaning in what he said. It was clear that it was just attracting attention.

Whether they agreed with his opinion or not, the eyes of the wizards in the lobby were focused on him.

In the meantime, I saw some of the coup d'état forces sneaking through the door. They started closing the door of the tower. No matter how much attention was focused on other places, there was no way that he could not notice that the large main gate of the tower was closed. However, the response was obviously delayed.

As soon as the people reacted, the door of the tower closed.

shudder!

The sound of a lock was heard.

'It started.'

Zich looked up at the tower. It was still a tower that stood tall and dignified as always on the outside, but now what unfolds inside will not be the same as always.


Where did all the gloomy atmosphere in the beginning go? The heat of the meeting was gradually overheated, and the high voice that spread throughout the meeting increased.

They criticize each other and point each other out. It was a meeting that was created to completely end this situation, but looking back at the situation, it was never going to end with this meeting.

There seemed to be some people who wanted to make their opponent shut their mouths with magic right away. I could see that the hand holding the cane was getting stronger.

The meeting, however, remained narrowly rational. Yelling and swearing are already flying around, but it's funny to use the expression "reasonable".

“Then you will continue to trust Ma Thapju!”

"of course!"

Another wizard countered Wayne's shout.

“For what reason do you have to step down!”

“What have you heard so far? Hey Yuu, how many times have I not explained that!”

“You think such rumors and sophistry are the real reason! What the hell is that head doing what it thinks!”

“That’s what I want to ask you! Debate and sophistry! You're saying that even when you see what's going on this time! I'm really envious! How can you have such a soft mind! I will most likely live without worries!”

" what!"

A few people broke into their studio, and in an instant, the meeting room became noisy like a market floor.

The moderator of the meeting tried to calm the hall. It didn't calm down right away. However, when the host knocked on the podium, demanding quietness in a loud voice, they shut their mouths one by one.

After the sound had subsided to some extent, the moderator asked him to refrain from making harsh remarks and proceeded with the meeting again.

“I’ll ask the master Matthew right away.”

The excitement still hasn't subsided, but trying to stay calm, Wayne said.

“Aren’t you planning to step down from Matapju?”

Wilwes looked straight at Wayne.

Several thoughts ran through my mind. Since this chaos began, he has thought about it several times.

Do you really have to step back? Could it be that his fault was that big? I thought about it with my eyes open for a few days.

And I could draw a conclusion.

“No.”

Resolute words echoed in the quiet hall.

Cheers and boos were mixed. Meanwhile, Wilwes and Wayne's eyes mingled.

it was

“•••I'll take a break. We hope to see you again after a break.”

At the host's words, people stood up one by one. Everyone was exhausted mentally and physically from the rough meeting.

Some stayed in the meeting room to exchange opinions, while others left the meeting room to cool off.

Wayne watched it slowly. Then I looked at my colleagues who had not left and were still standing.

They nodded to each other.

It was time to start planning.

Orland watched him quietly.

♦ * *

After eating bread, eating dessert, and drinking a drink, Zich was looking at the tower while poking his teeth. No matter what anyone says, he seems to be working for his leisurely life.

However, even for those who envied such a leisurely life, if he knew what Zich was going to do in the future, he would have given up on his gains or anything and would have run away.

The eyes of Zich, who looked up at the tower with a slightly bored gaze, changed.

'It's a signal.'

A piece of cloth presumed to be a robe came out from the window of the tower, which I was constantly looking at, and then went in. It was repeated a few times.

Orland's is clear. It was a sign that a coup was about to happen.

Jack stood up.

'I have to call them.'

I had to call for Lyla, Hans, and Snock, who were hiding in a deserted place.

Zich slowly moved away from the tower.

♦ * *

Some time had passed when Zich brought his companions.

“How is the condition inside?”

Lyla looked up at the tower.

“At least it is far from peace. I can trust you.”

“Do you feel good?”

“There is nothing bad about it.”

Lyla shook her head.

“Do it quickly. I'm worried about Elena."

"Elena won't have to worry."

“Don’t think that people like you will all get nervous. My body is fine, but my heart is hurt.”

“Aren’t you strong enough for your nerves?”

But Zich did not vomit any more. I walked in front of the tower.

The door to the tower was still firmly shut. And there were four men guarding it. All four were wearing robes. At first glance, he seems to be the magician of the tower.

But at least Zich didn't think so.

'I will never be a wizard. I'm hiding the weapon inside the robe.'

He was hiding it, but he couldn't avoid Zich's eyes.

Lyla asked from behind.

“What are you going to do? Are you going to sneak in?”

"no. I've done a lot of squeaking in the back so far. Now it’s my turn to write this.”

Zich clenched his fist and shook it. And Bomu also boldly approached the tower.

“Stop!”

As Zich approached, the man guarding the door raised his hand to block it.

“Right now, the tower is off-limits! No matter what the dragon is, I can't get in right now... !”

Whoops!

Zich's hand grabbed his face. No one reacted to such a natural action. Jack said with a smile.

"shut up."

Whoo!

Zich's arm moved. The head of the enemy caught in his hand was stamped on the wall of the tower.

perok

A dull and intense sound resounded. no screams Without even trying to close his drooping nose, the enemy slid down the wall, smeared with blood.

“Enemy!”

The other three drew their swords out of their robes at once.

“Aren’t you your wizard?”

Zich shrugged and pulled out Windur. He struck the sword that flew towards him with Winduru.

Kaang! Kaang! Kaang!

three beeps. The swords that were heading towards Zich were deflected all at once. The opponent's chest was clearly exposed. Windur revealed this sucker.

Scratch! Scratch!

Bright red blood spurted from both chests. Zich frowned, avoiding the blood rushing to him.

dump! dump!

Two bodies fell.

“Hey, this child!” The other one screams and runs towards Zich. But Zich didn't fight it. I turned my back on him.

The sharp sword seemed to cut through Zich's defenseless back at any moment.

But that didn't happen.

Whoops!

“Aaaaaaah!”

A fire engulfed him. A painful scream rang out. He loses his weapon and rolls his arms around the ground to put out the fire. But to no avail. Soon he was charred and breathless.

Jerk!

Someone passes by the burnt corpse. Lyla, who had just cast a spell, grabbed her wand and approached Zich with hardened eyes. Han Su and Snock followed her behind.

"let's go!"

Lyla said with a sense of full will.

“Good will. Yes, let's go wild and flashy."

Zich put his hand on the door and gave it strength. The rattle seemed to lock the door from inside. But Zich didn't care. Rather, it gave me more power.

Quazy!

He could not keep the meaning of his existence and the lock was broken too easily.

It's good!

The tower's door opened. The inside was revealed. There were several people in the lobby. They are people who don't look like wizards to anyone.

"who… !”

There is no bird to finish speaking. The enemies waiting in the lobby were torn apart without being able to resist the sudden sword of Zich. An attack without any hesitation.

Zich proudly stepped onto the tower. There was no one else to stop him.

The other party followed after Zich.

“Where are you going first?”

To Lila's question, Zich responded lightly.

"dungeon."

From there it would all start.

(Continued on next page)

We already know roughly the structure of the tower. Zich strode to find his way without any sign of getting lost.

“Dungeon? Is there anything like that in the tower?

Laila questioned the space that did not match the tower.

“It is a prison that specializes in confining wizards, not ordinary criminals. They say it is used to punish the wizards who sinned in the Magic Tower. It is empty now.”

“It would be best to detain wizards.”

"right."

“Who are you?”

It was also a place where people were locked up, so the surveillance seemed to be strict. When I turned the corner and arrived at the stairs leading to the basement, I saw people guarding the front of the stairs.

From the outside, he tried to hide his identity with a robe, but now he was in a state of taking off his robe as if it was bothering him at all.

Jack didn't respond. He slammed the ground and jumped.

"enemy… !”

It seems that he was trying to say something, 'the enemy!', but his words did not resonate until the end. And that opportunity will never come.

Quad Duck!

Windur plunged directly into the opponent's heart. The other was startled and tried to swing his sword, but a bright light swept over his body.

c

Drops of red blood scatter along the path of light. But there was not a drop of blood on Estelaide. Hans captured Estellade.

“Hans! Snock!”

"four!"

"Yep!"

“I’m protecting the troublesome people from coming.”

After giving the order, Zich turned his head to Lyla.

“What about you?”

“Is Elena down there?”

“There will be none.”

Lyla frowned.

“Wasn’t all those caught were locked down below?”

“No. Most of all, Elena is a burden that Orland will take over in the name of protecting us so we don’t go wild.”

Lyla's eyes widened sharply at the sound of the load. But he didn't stop talking.

“So you wouldn't have been locked up in the dungeon you were supposed to rescue from the beginning. Whatever the reason, I would put it in a slightly more dangerous place.”

"danger?"

As Lyla's eyes rose even more, Zich waved her hand.

“I wouldn't put it in a very dangerous place. At least, it's our protection, and we should be safe until we turn Elena over."

“Then where are you?”

“Isn't it somewhere upstairs? A truly high-ranking and dangerous wizard will be locked away.”

“••• Whoever hears it will think you are the one who caused this coup.”

“Would it be an exaggeration to say that I caused it?”

Zich giggled half-jokingly.

“So I’m going, I’m not going.”

After showing signs of conflict for a moment, Lyla stood next to Zich.

“I’ll go with you. You might be in danger.”

“Ha ha! That's right! I could be in danger!”

There's a lot of tee in her voice that doesn't even think so. But it wasn't sarcastic.

Even if it was a frivolous concern, Lyla's concern was not bad.

“Okay then, let’s see what kind of danger lurks underground. Maybe even a legendary dragon is building a nest.”

“Stop talking nonsense and get down quickly.”

Lyla patted Zich on the back.

* * *

When you think of a dungeon, it is easy to think of a dark, cold and gloomy place. However, the prison in Matoap was no ordinary prison.

It was relatively clean and well maintained. It wasn't for the prisoners.

Lyla, who followed Zich, made an impression. He stopped walking and raised his hand to activate a light magic.

Whoops!

A small fireball rose in her hand. However, the magic was constantly shaken as if exposed to strong winds.

“It’s hard to use magic.”

“Isn’t this a place where magicians are locked up? Of course, special treatment was given.” Lyla swept the wall. Along with the unique texture of metal, a strange flow of magical power was felt.

“Is there something in the basement itself that prevents you from casting magic?”

“It is said that he created a space that prevented the completion of magic by pouring a lot of rare metals such as Orihalcon and Mithril to create a skeleton and allowing magic to flow. It must be very difficult for most wizards to use magic, but... .”

Zich glanced at Lyla.

“I thought you wouldn’t have any problems.”

“Is there no problem?”

Lyla frowned and said. However, what followed was a saying that, if ordinary wizards who could not use magic in the prison heard it, they would open their eyes and grab the neck.

“It’s so annoying.”

“It was  enough for that kind  of reaction.”

After all, for Laila, this underground structure doesn't seem to be anything more than a nuisance. Zich continued down the stairs.

When we reached the end of the stairs, we saw two more watchers. But what they were watching was the inside.

Zich's footsteps were literally gone. Lyla looked at Zich with round eyes. clearly visible to the eye. However, Zich's presence had completely disappeared.

Zich openly approaches behind the watcher. But the watchers did not notice Zich at all.

Zich swung his sword.

Scratch! Scratch!

Two heads floated up as if they had originally had such powers.

The head falls and the body collapses. The blood that spurted out violently pooled like a puddle, expanding its power. Zich boldly climbed over the corpse and went through the door.

"Huh?"

"what?"

The enemies guarding the prison looked at Zich all at once at the blunt sound of a person's body collapsing. Their eyes crossed Zich and reached their comrades who had turned into corpses.

“That… !”

“Enemy!”

they take out their weapons Sieg heard Windur again. But as Lyla approached Zich's side, he took a step back. Lyla pointed her staff at the enemy.

I see the enemies holding on to laughter. They knew very well that magic was not used properly in the prison of the tower. Without any hesitation, they ran to Lyla.

But unfortunately for them, Lyla was no ordinary wizard.

damn!

there is no chant Several ice picks spawn near Lyla's staff. The enemies who saw the magic being activated were bewildered. However, Lyla glared at them indifferently and fired her magic.

High: OI 5X OI 3X OI

-r=r! -r=r! -r=r!

The sharp ice awl pierced through the enemies without mercy. Enemies bounced back faster than the speed of running.

As ice the size of his forearm was pierced everywhere, it was certain that he would not be able to survive.

"They're not that strong."

“Even with the cooperation of the robes, it is difficult to raise knife-wielding humans in a wizarding family. And I wouldn't have needed a guy so strong. I guess I just needed some fighting troopers who could do such chores.”

Zich and Laila looked around the prison while having a conversation like that.

There were quite a few people trapped behind the hard-looking grate. They were all wearing robes.

Some people have messy hair or clothes, and bruises and bloodstains on their faces, as if they were treated harshly when they were dragged. But fortunately, there seemed to be no serious injuries overall.

“•••You are obviously… .”

An old wizard who recognized Zich said in amazement.

“Isn’t that person who kidnapped Elena?”

“I think so… .”

A few more recognize Zich. And people who had never seen Zich recognized him by the words that some of them uttered. Zich was a celebrity in the city, albeit on the bad side. In a way, the cause of the confrontation that has brought tension to the horse tower was not Zich.

Of course, the gaze of Zich was not good. The eyes of the old wizard who recognized Zich first became sharp.

“Maybe you guys were involved in this too!”

He shouted at Zich, wondering if he was on the same side of the coup d'état, but thinking about it, the old wizard tilted his head.

If Sieg were on the same side of the coup d'état, they would not have killed the people who imprisoned them.

Zich said to those who looked at him suspiciously.

“I’m here to help.”

One word changed the atmosphere in the prison.

“•••You came to help?”

"That's right. I'll get you out first."

Zich pulled out the key hanging from one of the walls of the prison. Then, one by one, they opened the nearest prison.

Wizards walk out. Although they have not yet given up their doubts about Zich, people are relieved that they have been liberated.

Zich glanced over the liberated people. Also, there were no particularly important people in the tower, including Wilwes.

“There is no Elena.”

Lyla said in a slightly disappointed tone. He seemed to be looking for Elena, just in case.

“As I said before, Elena will be trapped above. Now I have to go get it.”

Zich froze Lyla.

"for a moment! You sound like you know where Miss Dwayne is, but do you know anything about the situation?”

Although they had released them, the old wizard who was beside them asked sharply whether they had yet to shake off their suspicions about Zich, as if they were watching him.

However, once Zich helped, the old wizard used a faceplate on Zich.

“Of course I do. As it is now for the coup happened in matap I know very well that  itjyo. "

“You know it well! How on earth!”

But Zich had no intention of answering the old wizard's words. He took a wand from the magic box. Although it is a wizard's wand, it is a cheap and popular wand.

But it was still better than nothing.

Zich handed it to the old wizard. The wizard grabbed it with complicated eyes.

“I don't have time to explain right now. I have no thoughts. You just have to decide.”

Zich continued to take out his wand from the magic box. And he gave it to other wizards as well.

“Will you quietly leave the tower like this, or will you lend power to subdue those who try to disturb the order of the tower with it?”

The eyes of the wizards changed. During the meeting, he suffered the humiliation of being imprisoned in a prison tower without even being able to resist the sudden attack.

Moreover, the sense of betrayal was even greater as the targets who attacked them were those who thought they were their comrades.

The old wizard clenched his wand.

“•••It did not dispel doubts about your identity. However… .”

The old wizard's eyes turned bloody.

“First of all, I understand that the idea that the traitors who dare to take the power of the tower must be beaten and captured first.”

“Can I really trust him?”

Another wizard spoke to the old wizard. The old wizard shook his head.

“I don’t believe it. Don't let anyone take your eyes off these two. But we must seek the Lord Matthew right now. Other things will be done after the order of the tower is corrected.”

“That’s it.”

Jack held out his hand.

“I don’t know if it will be a temporary alliance or a relationship that will last forever, but let’s get along well, at least for today.”

“I will only ask you one thing.”

The old wizard took Zich's hand

open mouth

td s. = 4、、 I •

“Are you decorating your own decorating work with your party alone?”

Jack said with a laugh.

"of course."

There was one idiot who believed himself to be an ally.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 270 screen

Snuwick's horse tower is said to be the best among many horse towers.

The inside of the tower, which seemed to look down on the surroundings with an unshakable presence like the height that stretched out high in the sky, was now fighting enough that it would fall into the category of war.

Whoops! Whoops!

All kinds of magic fly around the stairs. Balls of fire and water were thrown alternately, and occasionally lightning and wind embroidered the tower.

There were many magics that canceled each other, but there were also those that bounce off and hit the walls and stairs of the tower.

However, none of them could scratch the outer wall of the tower.

“I’m glad it’s strong!”

Zich said as he cut out a flying ball of fire. Behind him, Lyla spawned dozens of fireballs at once, literally bombarding the upper floors.

The enemy's magic was cut off for a moment by the enemies who screamed and hid themselves up the stairs. Zich jumped up the empty space as it was.

“It’s not just about being strong! The magic power has been reduced! Basically, it’s hard to use magic!”

Lyla, who had just used powerful magic, muttered uncomfortably. Jack laughed out loud at him. Then he said, slashing the enemy.

“Hold on! Because the tower's defense system has been activated! You warned me!”

The tower's defense system. It refers to the system that works when the Ma Tower is invaded.

There are a few things, but what is unfolding now was the reinforcement of the basic magic tower's own magical power and the disturbance of the magic spread inside the tower.

The power of magical interference, which is normally only spread in dungeons, ran out in an instant, spreading its influence upward.

Of course, its structure becomes stronger as it goes down, and it gets weaker as it goes up.

Therefore, if it is triggered when a fight between wizards occurs inside the tower, the wizards who occupy the top have an advantage.

It was a system that effectively prevented wizards from attacking the tower. And that was clearly evident in the current battle.

Whoops! Whoops!

From above, the magic was poured again. It is significantly weaker than the magic they normally use. However, the magic of the lower floors that countered it was even weaker than that.

However, the forces from the lower floors were gradually retaking the upper floors and pushing them up.

Whoops!

Laila, who unleashes a tremendous amount of magic regardless of the power of magical interference.

Quajiic!

It was Zich's fault for tearing up the flying magic.

Of course, Han Su, who wields Estelaide, and Snock, who deals with a large number of Mithril pieces, were also strong enough to push up the front line.

"O uh''
-- TH •

The old wizard, Alben, who was watching from behind, drooled.

he knew them Of course you don't know that well. It was only to the extent of hearing rumors floating around the tower.

A villain who kidnapped Elena Dwayne, the granddaughter of the matap master. At the same time, it is also the cause of the beginning of the infighting of the Matoap Tower.

Of course, I didn't even have a crush on my eyes. To be honest, working together right now is very frustrating.

However, it is true that some, including Wayne Jawick, staged a coup d'état, imprisoned Matapju, and imprisoned themselves, so the enemy of the enemy is holding hands with the feeling of being an ally.

That's how urgent he was.

But he had no choice but to ponder whether they should judge that they could join hands with them.

'… Wouldn't that have been enough for them?'

The power of magic interruption was dropping the power of great magic tower wizards, including Alben. And to a lesser extent, so is the power of the wizards on the side of the coup.

However, Zich and the others are unaffected by the power of Magic Interference in the first place, except for Laila, and Laila is extremely strong against that power.

In other words, in a way, the defense system of the horse tower was thoroughly creating a favorable environment for Zich's party.

It's good enough that one's side is strong, but the problem is that it's a person who has the potential to become an enemy in the future.

Alben's troubles deepened.

However, Zich and his party, who put Alben in trouble, pushed the tower up without hesitation.

“ Arrive on the 11th floor!”

When Zich spoke, Alben with his wand 1

He pointed to where the hallway on the first floor unfolded.

“There may be enemies! Check out all the rooms!”

Wizards rushed to the 11th floor. Zich blinked at Hans and Snock to help them.

“And I tell you, don’t look into other people’s research results! If anyone gets caught, even if it means ending my life in the tower, I will kick him out of the tower!”

Alben raised his voice.

“Is that person good enough?”

Leila murmured from behind Zich as he headed towards the landing connecting the 11th and 12th floors. Zich also glanced behind him.

“I looked into it a little bit, but he is not from a prestigious family, nor is he a wizard enough to participate in the highest magic conference, but he is a fairly prestigious wizard. He said that he was not from a good family and had little magic talent, but he gave up his family, family, friends, and everything else and only digs magic, so he was close to the right to participate in the Supreme Council of the Tower. Among those who are imprisoned in the dungeon, they have the highest status.”

“He’s a great man.”

Such a person was trusted.

Lyla looked up this time over the stairs and upstairs.

“I’m glad it’s going up fairly easily. There doesn't seem to be any damage."

“You misfired the tower defense system. Conversely, they are being harmed beautifully.”

“Will it keep going like this? You said that if things go according to plan, even those who are being held apart will escape and respond.”

“If it goes according to plan, it will be.”

“… Are you planning something else?” Lila asks suspiciously.

“You decorate. I just had a bad idea once. Defense systems aren't the only ones with magical sabotage power. There are some that are a little more dangerous.”

“Is it dangerous ?”

“You mean the final device.”

Lyla looked back in surprise. At some point, Alben was standing behind them.

I wonder if I've heard of the plan. However, Alben's expression did not change. Moreover, no matter how much Zich, there is no reason to have such a conversation when someone is approaching you. Lyla asked, trying not to show agitation in her expression.

“The final device?”

It's a word that makes you feel bad just by hearing it. But Alben said lightly, as if there was no need to worry.

“Don’t worry. Like the evaluation of the final device, it can only be operated by the Magician. And the current mage will never activate that device. Even if the lives of their sons and granddaughters rise to the scales.”

“… I don't know if it would be better to activate it." Alben looked at the beauty in front of him. Perhaps she was a genius wizard who taught Elena. As rumored, her magic was immense.

Jealousy, which I thought I had abandoned decades ago, was briefly rekindled. But after many years of training, the flame was soon extinguished again.

Instead, a question arose. Until now, Elena's name was often mentioned in her words and actions. And there was definitely a deep affection for that tone.

'•••Is he really the one who kidnapped Elena?' At least she didn't seem to have done anything bad to Elena.

Lyla clenched her wand. Zich was sure of Elena's safety, but Laila thinks that's right, as Zich said, but still, he can't help his emotions.

'Yeah, like Zich said, Elena will be safe. If that's the case, it'd be better if that final device didn't work... .'

Lila stopped thinking. Zich wielding Windur loudly in front of him. But his face was on Lyla.

with a strange smile.

'•••no way!'

The idea that her ill-fated colleague had done something futile was suddenly strong in Lila. No, it was already certain.

The top floor of the tower. Except for special events such as the supreme meeting of the matoap, the space dedicated to the master of mato is not a place that many outsiders enter, but now, on the top floor of the mato, there were a lot of wizards including Wayne.

They were the main actors in the coup.

Their plan was successful. He captured the mayor and high-ranking officials of Snuwick, as well as the matob lord and several other notable wizards. The plan came together so well that I wondered if it could be done this easily.

But the success of the plan is the most important law. They must achieve their will by finely suturing the torn, slicing, and tearful situations.

No matter how well the plan is implemented, if the end is shattered, the plan itself is a failure.

Sealing in the current situation means that Willwes uses the current coup to eliminate the static and neutralize the forces of the coup including Wayne.

That's why I took on the villain and prepared for it. There was anxiety, but it was for the sweet fruit that was about to fall.

In addition, although it was not long ago, they were even told that the unknown person who was leading them was Matap Master.

At that time, the shock that Wayne received was enormous.

The one who judged to be the last opponent to be defeated the most difficult was on their side. His head and guts exploded with exclamation. And the success of the plan turned into certainty.

Who knows that the upper echelons of the two opposing factions in the tower are actually holding hands. Just thinking about it made Wayne burst into laughter.

But all of that was being shattered now.

“Hey, damn it!”

quaang

Wayne smashed the floor next to a chair with his cane. His wand, which is very expensive, cannot be broken with just it.

However, due to the nature of the wizard who values ​​his wand, there are few people who treat his wand so recklessly.

It was a scene that clearly showed how angry Wayne was right now.

Wilwes, who was tied to a chair in silver handcuffs, looked at him coldly.

“What are you looking at like that!”

Wayne grabbed Willwes by the neck. There was even a kind of madness mixed there.

“You sent the password! You made all the plans! You led us!”

A dirty and ugly, but desperate shout is heard. But Wilwes was still apathetic.

“I don’t know what you are misunderstanding… .”

Wilwes said firmly.

“I never organized this coup. I never sent you a ciphertext. You either misunderstood, or maybe you were playing with someone else.”

“Wow, don’t be ridiculous!”

Kudang!

Wayne tossed Wilwes. Willwes rolls to the ground with will. Blood drips from his head wherever he hit him. But Wilwes' expression did not change.

“Are you going to forsake us?”

Wayne said cursing.

“I just want to use it and  throw it away! Yeah, you didn't mean to share power with us!"

"I will say one more time… .”

Wilwes said, glaring at Wayne.

“I am not. If I did then, even if I had devised a conspiracy, I think I would have teamed up with such lowly people as you.”

"profit!"

perok

Wayne kicked Wilwes. Taking damage from the furnace, Wilwes groaned. But Wayne kicked it several more times.

“Hey, hey! What will you do?”

Another wizard grabbed Wayne's shoulder and said urgently.

“Obviously, Ma Thap-ju said that he was on our side! That's why you didn't come up with this plan!"

"Hey! Answer me, Wayne Jawick!”

No other comrades, I can hear the scumbags barking. Those who have been faithfully listening to the unknown even before they reveal the identity of Wilwes are now shifting the blame to themselves.

laughter came out. The long-awaited dream of the master was flying away. No, it is now a situation in which his life and family are the problems beyond the fortunes of Matapju.

But it couldn't end here. He couldn't be the only one suffering from the conspiracy.

Shaking off the scum that rushed at him, Wayne glared at Willwes.

"You're not the conspirator?"

“Yeah, that’s right.”

Wayne chuckled.

“Then tell me. How do I know this?”

Wayne stepped out somewhere.

(Continued on next page)

The two vaporized

“Oh, hey! Where are you going!”

No mate, the dog barks at himself. But Wayne didn't care. The place he went to was where the master's desk was.

quaang

Nervously, he flips the desk over. Nogue, as a wizard, he usually builds a barrier against sports, and because he is Wayne, his physical strength is weakened, but is it because of his extreme anger? It wasn't too difficult to knock down the desk.

Where the desk disappeared, a small, square column appeared. It was probably hidden in the space under the desk. Seeing that, Wilwes rolled his eyes.

'What else are you going to do?'

The pillar was the device that controlled the tower's defense system. The power of the magic defense spread widely in the tower was also controlled by the coup force.

“What are you going to do!”

A wizard who participated in a coup shouts.

Wayne shook his head. His colleague looked at him in horror.

But I couldn't help it. The gleaming eyes clearly showed that Wayne was out of his mind.

“Give up.”

Wilwes said to him.

“Even if the tower's defense system is in place, it is not all solutions. I don't know if there are reinforcements, what are you going to do with a force that you have only a handful of? Stop making any more sacrifices... .”

"Shut up!"

Wayne exclaimed loudly. Wilwes refused to persuade. I'm not scared. Wayne was convinced that the words would no longer make sense.

“Not all solutions? Even if it's not a fundamental solution, there's a guy with enough power!"

“Are you talking about the final defense system?”

Wilwes had no choice but to bite his tongue.

“So how are you going to make it work? It is not a power that is allowed for you. And I never intend to activate that power.” Those with the authority to participate in the supreme meeting of the tower may deal with the defense system. However, the final defense system could only be dealt with by Ma Thap Master.

Wayne smiled madly.

“Are you still making excuses? Then tell me! How do I know this!”

Wayne started manipulating the device. Put your hand on the control unit and insert a specific pattern of magical power.

That was the password.

“No use… !”

Wilwes' eyes widened as he spoke of Wayne's futile effort.

So are the others. They looked at the small pillar rising from the center of the control unit with a look of disbelief.

That was the device that could trigger the final defense system.

“Yes, how are you… !”

“Didn’t you teach me!”

“Funny! When did I… !”

“You taught me!”

Wilwes shut his mouth.

“You, it’s all your fault! There was also a coup in the tower! I've come to this point! Everything that will happen in the future! It's all your fault!"

Wayne raised his fist hard and slammed the trigger. The trigger was pressed.

Woo woo woo!

Ominous magic began to flow through the tower.

'Is it time to escape slowly.'

Orland looked around. He was locked up in the tower conference room. I see people in the same situation around me. Unlike those who were imprisoned in the dungeon, they were all prominent in the tower. The coup forces kept them separate.

There is nothing like a dungeon in the conference room to prevent magic.

As long as the defense system is activated, the conference room will also be affected to some extent, but at least the people here are people who can overcome that power to some extent.

But the handcuffs they were wearing were limiting their freedom.

They were handcuffs made of the same material that Wilwess was wearing. It was a kind of artifact that was used to bind wizards.

It's not like they really suppressed the magic of wizards. It was just an object that exploded the moment it used any amount of magic power to use magic.

Because of this, no matter how skilled the wizards they were, they could not move around.

The same goes for Orland. He waited quietly, observing his surroundings.

how long has it been The door opened and a man came in. A small commotion was heard through the door.

The men who were watching them talk a few words with the one who just came in, then murmur for a moment. Then he left the conference room.

Orland clenched his fists.

'come!'

It is clear that Zich has moved in earnest. That meant he had to move too.

'Not right now!'

Orland glanced at the situation at the entrance. The number of watchers was extremely reduced. Perhaps he was summoned by force.

So some time passed.

'Okay then, shall I go out too?'

There are a total of five types of magic tower's wizard restraint handcuffs keys. Orland had already brought copies of all the keys to this meeting room. And he succeeded in secretly obtaining it in the wake of the previous commotion.

Averting the gaze of the watchers, he removed his handcuffs.

' done!'

He hides his handcuffs by crouching down. And secretly chanted.

jump!

Orland stood up. Everyone's eyes turned to him. Even the watchers draw their swords at his abnormal behavior.

But it was late.

Quad Duck!

The watchers froze at once.

“Come on, come on!”

I see wizards looking at them with surprised eyes. Seeing hope mixed in his eyes, Orland smiled inwardly.

'okay! That's it!'

It's always wonderful to feel like others are looking up to you. But hiding his heart, he released the handcuffs of others.

“I will tell you the story later. For now, we are focused on ending this insolence.”

The wizards nod their heads. At this moment, the implicit leader became Orland.

He took out a wand, which he had hidden like a key, which was more luxurious than the ones that Zich had provided to the prisoners, and gave them to the people.

“Helena!”

Elena was locked up with him. Elena, who had been dying all the time, raised her head, wondering if this happened because of her.

“You wait here! Someone will come to protect you soon!”

Seeing Elena nod, Orland led the wizards out of the conference room.

Now, if the coup force is overthrown in this state and the crime is overlaid on Wilwes, the conspiracy will succeed.

However, the plan did not go according to his will. A completely unexpected ordeal struck him.

"This… !”

A huge energy that surrounds the horse tower. Orland and the other wizards knew what it was. So I had no choice but to harden my face.

“Dwayne!”

A wizard standing next to him exclaimed.

“The final defense system has been activated!”

* * *

The magical power that had risen from the dungeon and covered the Magic Tower disappeared. But those trying to stop the coup couldn't like it.

Because more than that was starting to disturb them.

“Get down!”

When Alben shouted, all the wizards on the stairs fell to their knees.

Whoo!

Sharp chunks of ice flew over them and disappeared. The wizards slowly raised their heads. Alben's sharp sound pierced their ears.

“The final defense system has been activated! Always use magic only for defense!”

The wizards raised their wands and began to protect themselves.

The magic also flew to Zich and the others. Windur was swung around and the magic was split in two.

“Is this the final device of the defense system?”

" right."

Zich nodded and confirmed Lyla's words.

“The ability is simple. A huge magical storm blew into the tower. And all kinds of magic come out of that storm.”

Scratch!

As he cut off the stone that was shot at him, Zich continued to speak.

“The type, power, and location of magic are all completely random. Still, there is one limit. There is no magic of a scale and power beyond the standard.”

“This alone is dangerous enough!”

Lyla shouted as she intercepted the nearby magic.

“Isn’t this something that only the magician could activate? Could it be that Ma Thap-ju succumbed to the coup d'état?”

“It won’t be.”

Lila cut off Hans's doubts. And I looked at Zich.

“He must have done something.”

“But I had to give Wayne some proof to disguise Wilwes as the conspirator.”

Zich said brazenly, as if he was not guilty of anything.

Hans and Snock look around to see if anyone is listening.

Fortunately, the other wizards were in a hurry to defend the magic pouring from all directions, so no one listened to their stories.

"So what's the way to use it?"

“It’s a password to be exact. I secretly wrote it under the password they got. I just wrote down that magic pattern, but that was enough. If you are a high-ranking mage with the right to participate in the supreme meeting of the tower, you will know what that means.”

Zich swung Windur, this time smashing the magic that flew to the wizards behind him.

“Orland believes that his tactics are so good that the coup d'états see Wilwes as the backbone of this plot, but the key reason is the password I gave him. First of all, they also have access to the tower defense system, so I secretly checked whether it was correct or not, and was sure that it was genuine.”

“Then you’ve fallen into a trap.”

“That’s it.”

“Where did you get it from, it’s predictable, so it’s passed on, and is it really only for planning?”

"of course. I am a good person I had no idea that the sudden activation of the final defense system would upset Orland and mess up his plans.”

“I’ll definitely do it!”

Lyla negates one magic again and slapped Zich at the foot.

“If that’s the case, you shouldn’t have brought other people!”

“So you brought only a few. do not worry. Because those people can tolerate this level of defense system. With our help, we can get to our goal well enough.”

“Where is that?”

Zich said, pointing his finger up.

"meeting room."

* * *

Bomu also confidently left the meeting room, Orland, but his rosy outlook was suddenly shattered by the huge magic that shook the tower.

“Damn it! Wilwes Dwayne that little one! You really triggered the final defense system! I have my own subordinates too!”

“Are you crazy!”

A wizard screamed as he saw the wizards on the side of the coup d'état destroyed by the defense system while trying to stop them.

Orland was restless. It was to block the flying magic, but I couldn't understand how the final defense system was activated.

'Maybe my father passed on the password!'

He could only explain it like that, but Orland couldn't believe it. His father was never like that.

'Am I wrong!' But there was no time to think any further.

“Dwayne! Let's go back to the conference room for now! Moving forward like this is suicide! Don't you know that the power of the final defense system in the upper floors of the tower is different from that in the lower floors!"

Orland clenched his teeth. His head was spinning. But it didn't last long.

“••• Let's step back.”

We haven't moved far from the conference room yet. Return is possible. And the conference room is one of the few spaces that escapes the influence of the final defense system.

They once retreated back.

Fortunately, they were all made up of high-level wizards, so there were no casualties, although there were injuries. It was then that Orland entered the conference room again.

"You're here too, Mr. Dwayne."

Zich waved his hand to greet him.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 272 screen

“Mr. Zich!”

Orland welcomed Zich very warmly. But on the inside, he spit out swear words.

'Are you here already!'

Orland, who wants to take the credit for defeating the leadership of the coup d'état, was not happy that Sieg had already arrived in the conference room. And at the same time, it was surprising.

'Have you already breached the final defense system?'

No matter how weak the final defense system of the lower tiers is incomparably weaker than those of the upper tiers, it is that the upper tiers are incredibly strong, and the lower tiers are powerful enough.

But Zich broke through it within that short time. Looking at the wizards he brought, it doesn't seem like he's been harmed.

But no matter what thoughts he had in his mind, he reached out to Zich without showing it.

“You have been very successful!”

“Aren’t you the same?”

The two shake hands. One of the wizards who was moving with Orland looked at Zich suspiciously and said to Orland.

“This man must have kidnapped Miss Dwayne. Why is this person here?”

"I don't have time to go into detail, but he's my collaborator on this one."

"collaborator'?"

The wizard who asked the question, as well as the other wizards, expressed their doubts.

“He is the honorary paladin of Carwiman.”

“An honorary paladin. Isn't that already proven to be fake?"

“It is said that he showed a fake to Elena for some reason. We have confirmed the authentic proof and even received confirmation from the Temple of Carwiman.”

people were screaming No wonder he's really Carwiman's honorary paladin. Zich took out a badge and showed it to those who looked at him with surprised eyes.

Those who knew the token swallowed the chimeumseong.

“Maybe really… .”

“Then why did you kidnap Miss Dwayne?”

People started talking, and Orland stopped talking.

“I know you have a lot of questions, but let’s put that aside for a while! Now we need to go up to the top floor of the tower, catch the enemies and stabilize the situation!”

People thought for a moment, then nodded one by one.

“I take the lead.”

said Jack.

“You can’t go out without any preparation. It's amazing to have led other wizards this far without taking any damage, but the final defense system at the top is much more powerful."

“But there will be no time for that. As far as I know, if the final defense system is not stopped, the tower itself is in danger.”

The end of the final defense system is the collapse of the tower. Since it is a system that uses the magic power flowing through the tower, if it is not stopped within a period of time, the tower itself will be destroyed.

So Orland could not havetily objected. In the first place, there was no such thing as a final defense system in his plan.

“There is nothing to worry about. Is this my specialty? I should have shown it in the Jawick mansion. By breaking the magic of Ma Thapju.”

“… I can't help it.”

Orland had no choice but to agree in the end. The reason he plotted is to drive Will Weiss out and take over the tower.

For him, the collapse of the tower was absolutely unacceptable.

And now that things have come to pass, it is impossible to keep Zich and the others as Elena's escort. Now, advancing to the top of the tower was the top priority.

The other wizards who were listening to their conversation also made serious faces. There was not a single sorcerer who could accept the collapse of the existence of the Magic Tower.

“Would you mind stopping before then?”

“They started a coup and were pushed back, so they even activated the final defense system. I can't believe I'm not going to do anything worse.”

There were some doubts, but those too were silenced by Zich's words.

“From here on, we will go with a small group. I want Dwayne to choose the people in the tower.”

“I will.”

Orland gathers the wizards. Even at the highest meeting of the tower, he is at the very end of the meeting and naturally leads the wizards. Zich glanced at it.

'You have the ability.'

Zich took Hans and Snock to Lyla.

Lyla was with Elena. After seeing that Elena was in the conference room, she ran to Elena right away.

Lyla was looking around her body, asking Elena various questions. I was worried about where there were no injuries.

Fortunately, Elena was not seriously injured. He didn't have any magical powers, so he didn't even wear handcuffs for the wizard, and he was just tied up, so he didn't get hurt.

“Lyla. Time to go.”

"okay."

Lyla grabbed Elena's hand and said.

“You must never leave here. Understand?"

“Oh, okay.”

Elena hesitated, not knowing how to treat Lyla. It was concluded that he was a bad person, but looking back, it seemed that the situation was reversed again.

Didn't she know about her concerns? Lyla opened her mouth.

"do not worry. Because we're not really enemies of the tower. After this is over, I will explain everything.”

“… Yes, teacher."

In the end, she decided to trust Laila once more, so Elena calls her teacher.

Lyla's face brightened. But his face hardened at what he was thinking.

“And you have to eat strong and endure. Understand?"

"•••Yes."

Elena thought it was a consolation for Wilwes, who was known as the head of the coup. But that's not what Lyla was talking about. But I can't tell you now.

“After this case is over, let’s practice magic again.”

"Yes."

Lyla fell from Elena.

"it's over?"

"okay."

When Lyla joined, Zich turned to the entrance to the conference room.

“Then let’s go finish it.” Whoops! Whoops! Whoops! Whoops!

Orland wasn't lying when he said that the defense system at the top of the tower was much more powerful.

As if to prove that word, the magical storms that were shot out in all directions frantically made people get tired just by looking at them.

To the extent that I can only think of jumping into it as an act of suicide.

So Orland thought it would never be easy to get to the top. In the meantime, it was expected that considerable damage would be healed.

However, the situation turned out a little differently than he thought.

Zich extended his sword to one side.

Whoo!

The magic that had been gathered to one side was scattered as it was, as if magic had been activated in an instant. At the same time, the surrounding magic was also canceled. The mana that had been running wild became calm as much as the space.

“Run!”

Zich took the lead, and the wizards hurriedly followed.

'•••It's amazing.'

Orland stuck his tongue out at the sight in front of him. To that extent, Zich's ability was worth putting out his tongue.

Apparently, the final defense system was created based on the runaway of horse power, so there were a lot of places where the elements were unstable.

Zich was creating a safe space by accurately capturing the unstable place and forcibly tearing it apart with vast magical powers.

'It's not like I nullified my father's magic.'

Of course, since he had experienced the final defense system before returning, Zich attacked the tower more easily, but there was no way Orland could know that. Orland got a little nervous as Zich's ball seemed to be getting too high. But I forced my heart into it.

After all, Zich is not a member of the tower. No matter how good he is, he cannot become the master of the tower.

'I have no problem with my plan to become the master of the tower.'

It's going to be a little more difficult because your own ball falls.

But that's something to think about later. Orland, like other wizards, intercepted the magic that Zich couldn't get rid of and climbed up.


Quang!

Zich knocks down the huge door that appears in front of him. In an instant, a great magic flew over to Zich. But Zich had already been pulled back and pulled out.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

This attack was quite strong, so the horse tower rang. Even the horse tower, which was strengthened with magic, was unavoidable with this power, so part of it was broken and stone dust fell down the dam.

taat!

Zich ran forward again. You can see the wizards sticking out their wands towards the entrance. They were the last remaining coup d'état.

All others will either get caught in the final defense system and die or be evacuated to a safe place.

“Inoo omg!”

Wayne put his wand at Zich. Zich accelerated further.

hooo

The wind magic of the silent window flies. Zich leaned over and lightly avoided it. Other wizards are running around trying to blow away their magic.

But the wizard was also on Zich's side.

Whoops! Whoops! Whoops!

Magic flew from behind Zich. Contrary to the magic of the coup d'etat that blows without chanting, they are powerful magic that completes the chanting perfectly.

“Great!”

“Aww!”

The magicians of the coup d'etat caught in the magic scream and fall apart. In an instant, the standing enemy was reduced to a single Wayne Jawick.

Zich walked up to Wayne.

“Ahhhhhh!”

Wayne swung his crook and swung his staff. But how powerful is the wand wielded by the old wizard?

Scratch!

Wayne's high-quality staff was cut off in vain by Windur.

perok

just clench your fist Wayne's body was blown away by a fist pierced straight into the ball.

Woodang!

He was shabbyly locked in one side of the room.

All the wizards on the side of the coup that were standing there disappeared.

“Take the boys.

At Orland's command, the wizards entered the room. Those who were wounded and limping were put on handcuffs that were exclusively for wizards they had brought.

“Where is your father!”

Orland grabbed the neck of the coup d'etat wizard and threatened him. But the answer came from another place.

“You are over there.”

At Zich's words, Orland looked at where Zich was pointing. There he saw Willwes lying on a chair tied to him.

“… father?"

Orland was skeptical. A wizard approached him behind him.

“Isn’t this coup caused by Matap Master? Were we wrong?”

He spits out hopeful observations. Orland shook his head and said heavily.

“It could be mine.”

“Anyway, we won.”

Orland walked over to Wilwess and put the chair back. It didn't make sense that Wilwes had been beaten quite a bit. He looked up at Orland, where he had established himself.

Dwayne's eyes crossed.

“•••You have suppressed the coup. Well done."

Wilwes smiled faintly. But Orland didn't laugh.

“Did your father lead this coup?”

"No way. What is it that I like to lead this work? Besides, look at me. Where did you look like their boss?”

“It’s a lie!”

A voice was heard in denial of Wilwes' words. It was Wayne. Kneeling to the ground, handcuffed, he looked at Willwes and shouted.

“We were obviously moving according to the orders of the Master Ma Thap. Now, that’s just the acting of Ma Topju!”

"gibberish."

“Then how the hell do I know the password for the defense system end device?

I mean!”

Wilwes didn't answer that either. That's what he wanted to ask more.

“•••No matter what happens, if you do research, it will come out. But, perhaps, it is not going to be very favorable to my father.”

"what?"

“Because the honorary paladin of Carwiman thinks his father is the culprit.”

Orland pointed to Zich. Willwes was surprised to see him.

“The author… !”

The shaman who dared to kidnap Elena. Why is that person here?

"Yes."

Irrespective of Wilwes' gaze, Jiku nodded. And he said so with a solemn face.

“I know the culprit.”

(Continued on next page)

# No. 273 Tuesday

“You’re the culprit… .”

I did not understand why the person who kidnapped Elena was like the other wizards in the Devil's Tower at this time, but his words and actions were also sinister.

Isn't it like saying that you are the main character of this coup?

“Why is the author here?”

“He is the honorary paladin of Carwiman. You have been very helpful in suppressing this coup.”

“An honorary paladin of Carwiman. Wasn't that fake!"

“It is true. He deceived Elena into thinking that it was too early to reveal her identity by showing the old fake tokens. The fact that that person is real has already been confirmed at the Carwiman Temple.”

“•••Did you confirm?”

If the temple had even confirmed it, there is a high probability that Orland's words were true.

"Yes, it is. He's been pursuing the group of groves that first kidnapped Elena for a long time. Then I confirmed that the collaborator was in this city.”

Orland says, as if bragging about what he had done.

Jack didn't say anything. He just shrugged his shoulders and affirmed the gaze on him.

“He named his father as his collaborator.”

“What!”

“And he said he was trying to blame me for this.”

“What nonsense! Why the hell am I!”

"Yes. I still believe in my father. Yes, I want to believe it. But it is. These are the words of the honorary paladin of Carwiman. I have no choice but to be a little suspicious. So I thought about it. If my father was the leading figure in the coup, why would he do that?”

Orland's eyes are heavy. It's like eyes that want to somehow deny that fact when they face an unbelievable fact. Seeing this, he was amazed inside.

'He's really good at acting.'

“My father today is a truly impeccable man. As a magician and as a magician. But you didn't before.”

“… People can change. And I have changed.”

His voice was low, as if it wasn't a very good memory for Wilwes. However, only the will contained in his voice was strong.

“Yes, it was. I thought so. But though. What if my father hadn't changed?"

“What do you want to say?”

“The way my father is now is all acting, and it’s not that I don’t understand if the real figure of my father is the same as before.”

People around me groaned. Even Wayne, who was staring at Wilwes with bloodshot eyes, looked at Orland in surprise.

“My old father was a cold-hearted person who put his family ahead of his family. He also had great ambitions for power. If the father at that time has continued to this day, there is only one thing he wants. The power of the tower.”

Orland looks down at Wilwes.

“One of the reasons why my father became the owner of the mage was clearly a changed personality. If he continued to have that self-righteous appearance of the past, there would have been people who would object to him even if his father was the best wizard in the tower.”

No matter how important the magic tower was, as long as it was a place where people gathered, emotions could not help but intervene.

“If that’s why he disguised himself, it’s understandable that his personality has changed as it is now. However, he changed his personality so softly that people began to unexpectedly disregard his father's power. As a self-righteous father, he wouldn't have liked it. So this is what I planned. As a friendly coup.”

“Is it because I use the coup d’etat as an excuse to get rid of the enemy and to consolidate the power of the mato?”

“Exactly.”

Orland nodded calmly at Wilwes' words.

“And I was trying to put the blame on you? What do you mean, son!”

In the end, Willwes exclaimed as if he couldn't stand it. However, Orland's expression did not change.

"That's right. To me, your disgrace and blemish.”

"you… .”

“And maybe Elena was like that too, wasn’t it? So I kidnapped Elena. If Elena is kidnapped, everyone will have no choice but to look at you. It would have made it much easier to prepare for a coup. Get rid of your incompetent granddaughter who can't use magic at all, your blot.”

“I tried to save Elena!”

“Because it wasn't my father's collaborator who kidnapped Elena. Rather, they were all dead. So, don't you feel a sense of crisis?"

“Orland!”

The eyes of the two rich men mingled fiercely. People couldn't breathe and looked at it.

It was Orland who retreated. He closed his eyes and sighed. He said, pressing the corners of his eyes as if tired.

“This is just my imagination. And I hope I'm right."

Then he turned his head to look at the wizards in the tower.

“I will arrest you.”

"I'll do it."

Jack came out.

“I think other people are colleagues in the same tower, so I think it’s better for me to do it. Of course, if the person in the tower wants to finish the work, I will give it to you.”

“… No, Mr. Zeek will do it for you. We have received too much of your help to ask us to finish it.”

There were no voices of opposition.

“Then I will arrest you.”

Jack came. Orland looked up at the sky. But the sky is invisible. All you can see is the ceiling of the tower.

People didn't want to see his father arrested, so they thought he had shifted his gaze.

It wasn't. He only raised his face in order to suppress the joy that surged in his chest, and in case anyone noticed the joy in his eyes.

'Success!'

he was delighted

'I brought my father down!'

Now, as long as he incites public opinion with the evidence he has secretly prepared, Wilwes has no choice but to be dragged down from Matapju.

Of course, it's not completely over. His goal is to be the next mage, not just the downfall of Willwes.

'And I have to deal with it.'

Something unexpected happened, and the plan was greatly pulled. That made the plan very loose. There is a gap.

In addition, you need to verify the evidence that Zich has, and how Wayne learned the code for the final defense system.

But Orland was confident.

'As long as the coup is successfully completed, I can control the rest to some extent.'

The achievement of preventing a coup. In addition, if there is support from Zich, who is the person who blocked the coup like him, who is the honorary paladin of Daga Carwiman, he can exert a powerful influence.

'In the end, it's my victory!' It was when Orland was so moved.

Tuk!

I heard something fall. Orland looked down and looked ahead.

Zich cut off Willwes's shackles and then unshackled his handcuffs. The only sound he heard was the sound of handcuffs falling to the ground.

Orland was surprised. No matter how injured he was and he didn't have a wand, how could he unleash Wilwess' captivity?

I can feel the murmur of other people's emotions as well as Orland's. But Zich's expression was relaxed. He turned his back and walked over to Orland.

“Gee, Mr. Zich. Why did you replace your father's captivity? !”

hooo

A sharp sword was pressed against Orland's neck, who was trying to contain Wilwes as he spoke urgently. It's a bizarre looking sword, but only the sharpness is real.

Silence filled the room. The people who were buzzing took their breath away, and Wilwes, who was puzzled by the sudden release of the captives, was also surprised.

But, of course, it was Orland who was more surprised than anyone else.

“Hey, what is this!”

“I am just doing what I have to do.”

“No,” said Zich in a tone that was appropriate for the expression “no,” he said.

“We need to arrest the robber's collaborator and the one who led the coup.”

“Then why are you pointing your sword at me! We have to arrest the father over there.”

“Because Wilwes Dwayne is not the culprit.”

"•••what'?"

For a moment, Orland did not understand what he was hearing now. As if he felt sorry for him, Zich explained a little more.

“You still don’t understand? The perpetrator who organized the coup, kidnapped Elena, and cooperated with the robbers.”

Zich pushed the sword a little more to Orland's neck. and smiled and said

“That’s your bastard, you asshole.”

Throwing away even respectful words, Zich said lightly.

People around him hardened at Zich's shocking remarks. But as if a huge fire magic exploded, people's reactions exploded.

The people who had their eyes wide open, those who closed their mouths, those who looked around, etc. each reacted differently, but the only thing that remained the same was that they were in confusion.

"•••what?"

Even Wilwes, who was told that he wasn't the culprit, couldn't keep up.

But it was Wayne who reacted the most to the extreme.

"Do not be ridiculous!"

he cried

“It was Wilwes Dwayne who led the coup! Not Orland Dwayne!”

“I made you believe that, you idiot.”

Wayne's bloody emotions were trampled on by Sieg too easily.

“How can you be induced like that just by using the ciphertext? How stupid are you? No, is it that Orland is that good? Anyway, it looks like Orland is above you.”

“Hey, hey, hey!”

Wayne's face turned red. The wriggling of his fingers is a sign of wanting to use magic right away.

The wizards standing around him flinched. If Wayne uses magic now and the handcuffs explode, they'll take damage too.

Fortunately, Wayne wasn't even that sensible.

“Then how the hell did you give me the password for the final device!”

“Oh, then I saw that.”

Zich said looking at Willwes.

“Would you mind stopping the final defense system for now? If this happens, the tower will collapse.”

“Oh, yes!”

Wilwes rushed to the control unit. And quickly pushed in the magic pattern to prevent the collapse.

“Look at that!”

Wayne exclaimed.

“If not Wilwes, who the hell taught that!”

“I taught.”

"what'?"

Wayne's mouth widened. Others look at Zich with their eyes wide open. However, he didn't even have the jaw to move Zich's facial muscles with just that much gaze.

“I wrote it under the cipher text Orland sent.”

After giving Wayne a single wink, Zich turned his gaze to Orland.

“Do you think you did all that well and believed these guys to be the main character of the coup? No matter how many of those guys were, they were still suspicious. I wouldn't have followed your orders so blindly if I hadn't given you the code. It happened because I helped.”

Then he remembered something.

"Oh, then I'll have to undo what you said before Wayne Jawick. Because he had enough grounds to believe it. Ummm, then who are you going to hit higher?”

But soon Zich gave up worrying.

“No need to think. Both are stupid chess horses in my hands.”

"this...!"

perok

Orland slashed Zich's sword. Then he brought the wand to the front of Zich's face. Magic swirled in his staff.

It looked like the tide was turned over in an instant, but there was no sign of being shaken by Zich. It wasn't that he couldn't resist, it was more like he didn't resist.

“Play as much as you can! No matter how much you are the honorary paladin of Karwiman who helped me put down the coup, I can't stand this insult any more!"

“It’s no joke, Orland Dwayne.” Unlike before, Zich spoke to Orland without a smile.

“The reason I told you that Matap Master was suspicious, and the reason I pretended to cooperate with you, was to bring out the allies of the robes who were connected to you through this coup. So listen carefully, Orland Dwenyne.”

With Orland's increasingly contorted face, Zich said firmly.

“You are the mastermind behind this coup!”

(Continued on next page)

# No. 274 screen

"gibberish! Bullshit!”

Orland denied it.

“I am not the mastermind of the coup! No, to be honest, you are the most suspicious of me! How could only the master of the tower know the code for the final defense system of the tower!”

Attacks Zich in reverse. Zich shrugged.

“How did you happen?”

“Do you think that the password for the final defense system of the tower is so poorly managed that you accidentally find out! After all, you are the most suspicious!”

"Hahaha! Hey Orland Dwayne. You are the one who guaranteed my identity. While getting confirmation from Carwiman. But this time, am I suspicious? If I'm really hostile to Mato, you can't escape that responsibility either."

“I, I just trusted Carwiman!”

“Then you’re saying that Carwiman can’t be trusted now?”

U  | 99

He wanted to shout 'Yes!' at any moment, but Orland did not dare to speak.

Carwiman, who spreads worldwide and exerts a strong influence. No matter how precarious he was, Orland didn't have the courage to openly say he couldn't trust Carwiman.

Zich said, tapping his head with his finger.

“You have to think about the words. Or, whatever you say, you have the power to make others dissatisfied.”

"profit!"

Orland grinded his teeth. His hands trembled as if he wanted to use magic right away. However, in the end, the magic of the staff was not used.

“Mr. Zich… You said.”

"That's right."

To a wizard who carefully asked himself a question, Zich responded cheerfully.

“Are you really saying that Orlando Dwayne is the leader of the coup?”

"That's right."

“It’s a lie!”

Zich's positive and Orland's negative overlapped.

“I tried in many ways to put down the coup! Don't you know! Why would I be the leader of a coup!”

Orland spoke to the others as if complaining.

“Because I’m aiming for Matapju.”

But Zich simply slapped Orland's claim.

“If you bring down the current Magic Tower and blow away many high-ranking wizards, you will get closer to the position of the Magic Tower Lord. Knowing that a coup is about to happen, it's easier to prepare for it. In other words, it becomes easier to set the ball. And if the suppression of the coup d'état is significant, of course, the position of the master will be close to that extent.”

“I never did!”

People had a hard time figuring out who to believe. But it wasn't just one, Wilwess.

He was unaware of the existence of the coup, let alone leading the coup. In other words, there was only one suspect for him now.

“Orland, you really… .”

"no! God damn it! You were the one who really led the coup!”

“I am not!”

Arguments between the two rich men collided. As their angry eyes stared at each other, Zich intervened quietly. He told Wilwes.

“Like I said, I'm chasing the robes. They corrupt people, often making people around them allies. This time they're targeting you, Wilwes Dwayne, and your allies are Orland Dwayne here."

“If you keep making weird noises, I will really kill you!”

“Do what you like. But, wouldn't people really doubt you then? I mean, you did something suspicious of killing anyone who tried to testify against you.”

"profit...!"

Zik continued to speak, lightly shutting Orland's mouth.

“It was discovered that other families that had coup d'état also received the cooperation of the robes, but they must have been only a target for use. The real collaborator is Orland Dwayne. The robes would have baited what Orlando Dwayne really wanted.”

Zich said, pointing to Orland's wand in front of his face.

“Just magic.”

“•••What does that mean?”

Wilwes asked.

“Originally, you said that this man was not very talented at magic, right? That helped.”

“How to develop the magic of the untalented! Could there be such a way!”

If there is such a method, the very foundation of magic is shaken. Because of this, Wilwes had no choice but to shout and deny his situation and circumstances for a moment.

“I don't know exactly how. They know a lot of very unusual methods. But it’s roughly predictable.”

Zich looked down at Orland arrogantly and said shocking words.

“It’s stealing someone else’s magic.”

"•••what'?"

Wilwes' mouth gaped open. Other people's reactions were no different. Only Orland stared at Zich as if to kill him.

“The bullshit… !”

“It’s not bullshit, Orland Dwayne. Upon investigation, it was found that the time when you fully manifested your magical talents was not much different from the time your wife died. Besides, the magic you have bloomed, coincidentally, belongs to the school you belonged to.”

Orland's face hardened.

“I thought there. I wonder if the great magic you obtained was stolen from your wife. They say your wife was also a very talented wizard. Someone with a talent that I wouldn't even make eye contact with if you weren't Dwayne's human."

“How far! How far are you going to mock me? I stole my wife's magic!”

"okay. And I even think that maybe that's why your wife is dead."

puck!

Orland swung his wand. The hard tip of the wand slammed into Zich's face.

Zich's face turned for a moment. Blood was dripping from the corners of his mouth.

Orland glared at Zich fiercely.

“Like you said, my wife and I were arranged marriages. Married life wasn't good either. But I killed my wife to take the magic away? Even nonsense has a degree! Is stealing someone else's magic in the first place absurd?"

Orland exclaimed loudly. The atmosphere around him was already showing signs of sympathizing with Orland.

He could not convince himself that he could steal someone else's magic, and he had a strong dislike for Zich even bringing up Orland's dead wife.

But Zich didn't care.

He spit and spit out the pool of blood in his mouth.

“Is it possible? I think it's possible enough. It's like you're stealing your daughter's talent."

Orland's movements stopped.

“Did I tell you before? When we educate Elena using the magic of the earth's revenge. It is said that the magic power is gradually dissipating. I thought it had stolen Elena's magical talent somewhere. And I found it.”

Whoops!

Zich grabbed Orland's neck. He put his face in front of his face and said.

"Tell me. Why the hell was the magic of Knowwem mixed with the magic used by the Jaewick family?”

Orland's eyes widened.

“Honestly, I didn’t know who the collaborator was at first. You and Ma Thap-ju, the two of us narrowed down the suspects, but after that, it was difficult. But seeing your magic imbued with the magical power of Nowem, I was convinced.”

Orland pursed his lips. Hopefully, his true identity will be revealed there.

“Hey, that’s a lie… .”

“If anything, let’s make Elena use her magic power right away. And after that, you use magic. If your magic is clean then you will be innocent

Ji. How about doing it right now?”

Orland's excuses were blocked by Zich. If he did as Zich said, the disadvantage was obviously Orland himself.

“••• Surely, really!”

When Orland didn't respond, the crowd looked at Orlandal in surprise. His gaze soon turned into anger and contempt one by one.

“Oh, no! I am not… !”

Orland rushed to make excuses, but Zich cut even his last excuses.

“Give up, my friend. I've already found evidence that you're the culprit in several places. It was as easy as pretending to cooperate with you.”

Jack smiled brightly. An amazing smile that doesn't even look like an eyebrow of friendliness.

“Did you think you finally achieved your goal? Were you happy and delighted? So what do you do with this The fate in front of you right now is not the rosy future of becoming a mage master, but a dark future where you will be punished for various crimes, including a coup. How about a moment's hope, was it sweet?"

“ oooooo •••(”

—,--,-----• Orland's wand trembles. He looked at Zich with bloodshot eyes.

“Hey, damn it, you motherfucker!”

Whoops!

In an instant, a huge amount of magical energy was released from Orland's body. Furniture in the room flew away and people bowed down.

Zich also used Windur as a shield to block the wind.

"You've finally revealed your true nature!"

“Kill it! I will never kill you!”

He shouted in a voice full of hate.

It was not seen except as he acknowledged his guilt. Wilwes stared blankly at the scene.

“•••Is it true? Did you really do this, Orland!”

“Yeah, I did!”

He shouted, glaring at Willwes.

“Why would you do such a foolish thing… !”

“Come here and put your father’s face away!”

Wilwes made a shocked face.

“Since when have you been interested in me? You didn't even treat me like a child just because I didn't have any magical talent! I mean, don't let a guy like that come and make a face like that!"

The magic that Orland was exhaling grew even wilder.

“Don’t ask me why! You have to train your magic somehow and somehow win the power of the tower! Because I learned all of them from you! Even so, if you ask me, I have only one reason to answer! That's the same reason you tried to seize the power of the tower!"

Wilwes shut his mouth. The white expression on his face seemed to have been frozen by Orland's magic.

“Don’t talk about your father again! Because I never thought of you as a father after you stopped paying attention to me!”

He resolutely declared the severance of the rich man's relationship. Wilwes didn't say a word back.

“Um, I have a deep resentment towards my father. Well, I understand why you tried to frame Ma Thap-ju. But why did you steal the talent from Elena? Wasn't he the one who would avoid that child?"

Going back seriously, there was an atmosphere that made it difficult to intervene between Wilwes and Orland, but Zich broke that atmosphere at once and asked Orland.

“When the father does well, the child does well! Besides, I had no intention of taking away his talents forever!”

Zich's favorite, garbage-like answer came back.

“It’s funny. Do you not even think about the wounds your child will receive until then? Anyone can see that your actions are the same as those of your father, whom you cursed so much? No, you are more like trash.”

“This child!”

Orland hit the floor with his cane. A staff full of magical power made a loud noise.

“You mean you know how I feel? I don't live up to my expectations, and my family only looks at me with contempt! People around me get ridiculed for not being able to use a single magic properly! You guys have been through this kind of situation!”

“ O  ”
huh •

Zich nodded his head too easily to Orland, who was pouring out his anger as if he was vomiting blood. Orland's attitude was to the point that he was unable to speak for a moment.

" what'?"

“My deceased mother often complained that she was lacking in every way, and the new step-mother tried to pass on the family to her younger brother who was born later. Because of his mother's behavior, his father also lost his affection, so he tried to pass on the family to his younger brother, and the vassal around him looked at him with contempt. Besides, I couldn't release my magic properly until I got older, so I was eventually ignored even by the servants. Doesn't this seem like a bad environment for you too?"

“You’re talking as much as you can!”

“It’s not how it goes. It is absolutely true.”

Jack raises his chin and says. Not a single lie was felt there.

There was no clear subject in Zich's words, but everyone who heard them thought it was Zich's story. Hans, who was stabbed, was fiddling with Estelaide for nothing.

“You went through something like that, but you became Carwiman’s honorary paladin?”

Orland contorted his face ugly. Zich's remarks were clearly a criticism of him. Despite experiencing a similar growth environment, one is a traitor and the other is an honorary paladin. Orland wanted to spit at this obvious difference.

However, the answer returned was completely different from what was expected.

“No, he is trash. It also became a great villain that cannot be compared to a minor villain like you.”

“This child! making fun of me... !”

"However!"

Zich interrupted Orland's angry words.

“At least I didn’t blame anyone for the result.”

That was a mockery the Demon King made to a very small villain.

“Clearly, the past may have had an influence. Maybe that life itself was manipulated by someone. But at least the choice to get there is yours.”

Even if someone guided me down that path.

“So, don’t hold me accountable for the past!”

Of course, hitting people who manipulated their lives or those who fucked them up is another matter. Zich clearly distinguished that.

“… Are you saying I'm wrong?"

People hate to have their opinions denied. Even more so, if being denied is your way of life, you have no choice but to protest.

Naturally, Orland's judgment was twisted.

But Zich didn't care about his feelings. Therefore, this answer was never seen by him.

"no? I'm just letting you know how I feel. It's like, 'I'm the happiest person in the world!' you were saying the same thing It just corrected the mistake.”

It's funny to say that you are walking the path of the Demon King and giving advice on someone else's path.

“I’m a careful person who doesn’t care what other people walk. So you go on living your way. No matter how you feel, whether or not you have a coup d'etat, I do not judge right or wrong. However, I will continue to live my life my way, and as long as you cooperate with the robes, our paths will naturally collide. Well, I talked about it over and over, but to sum up what I want to say, this is it.”

Zich said to Orland, aiming Windur in an attacking stance.

“Peach, let’s do it our way!”

quaang

Zich was shot. Zich's sword filled with all kinds of magic flew towards Orland's heart.

tuung

Zich's sword bounced off. Suddenly, an intangible curtain spread in front of Orland.

“So, after all, you are doing your own thing, aren’t you?”

“Who says what! If we worked hard to show off our misfortunes, what would we get? Because they are absolutely unnecessary in the current situation! I don't know about your circumstances, and you don't even have the emotions that will make you cry if someone else has lived a similar life to you!"

Quad Duck!

Zich rotated his wrist and swung the deflected sword once more. Windur half penetrated the intangible curtain.

"Act!"

Orland's wand's magical power fluctuated.

Quad Duck!

The surrounding temperature dropped sharply, and large ice pillars began to rise around Orland. They penetrated everything around them and expanded their influence.

“No, stop it!’

The other wizards moved their wands in a hurry to respond to Orland's magic. All of them were wizards of a considerable level, but for now, it was all they could do to block Orland's magic with all their might.

'Hmm, are you tired too.'

No matter how Zich came to release the defense system at the forefront, even the wizards had to work hard to break through the defense system.

It was natural to be tired as he moved in a state where magic was constantly disturbed with a low-priced staff he was not familiar with.

But that wasn't the only thing.

'The guy's magical power has definitely gotten stronger.'

Orland is a magician who has the right to participate in the highest meeting of the tower, even though it is the end of the day. If the magic power gets stronger there, it's bound to be annoying.

“Zeek! May it be... !”

“You are right, Laila.”

If it was like a runaway, there must have been a gap or awkwardness somewhere in Orland's magic. But Orland doesn't feel like that.

'I didn't run out of my own power, and it's probably not even my original power.'

Then one thing comes to mind. Where to bring new power.

“You are stealing something from Elena.”

Elena's talent is enormous, but right now, she doesn't have anything to call magical power. If it was stolen, it would be something else.

or life force.

“Kill that bastard right now!”

Lyla exclaimed. She also came to a conclusion similar to that of Zich.

“You damn child! You made a fuss about being hurt by your father, and how much are you trying to take away from Elena!”

"shut up! I'm not like my father! He was usually a good father to him! You also supported my dreams and supported me! What's wrong with getting a little bit back at this point!"

"nice! The garbage declaration without hesitation! It's totally my favourite!"

“Zeek!”

“Don’t worry, Lyla. I don’t want to waste any more time.”

Zich repaired Windur.

“After all, Elena is a disciple that Laila cherishes a lot. I can't tolerate you taking something from Elena right now, I can't believe it's helping Elena. So how about dying quickly if possible? Stop bullying your daughter!”

Zich runs towards Orland. After that, Lyla's magic supported it. Hans and Snock also helped Zich attack Orland.

Whoops! Whoops!

Lyla's magic struck Orland, but Orland skillfully blocked them. But there was no time to let go of Zich's attack that followed.

Other wizards also began to join the attack. Apparently capable, they attacked Orland, dodging Zich who was close to him.

“Hey, kids!”

Whoops!

Once again Orland's magic flowed out. Enormous magic was shot from Orland.

"Hey! If I use that much, will your daughter be okay?”

“So you guys should die soon, you bastards!”

Quad Duck!

Breaking a piece of ice, Zich frowned. The recoil is definitely bigger than before.

'It looks like they're really determined and sucking.'

Quad Duck!

The floor was already covered with ice spikes Orland had created. Each one has a lethal power, so it's annoying.

“Ha ha!”

Koo!

Zich's attack was blocked by a huge wall of ice. Through the translucent ice, Orland's face was seen with a crooked smile.

Quazy!

Avoiding the cold air surrounding him, Zich ran backwards. The place where he was was instantly surrounded by ice.

“Ha!”

Hans slashed the block of ice and swung his sword. But even Estelaide could not easily cut through the cold barrier.

“Know!”

coup!

Snok pours out chunks of mithril. However, they too were frozen in the intense cold and did not make satisfactory movements. Some were even trapped in ice.

'It's a little annoying.'

It was time for Zich to find a hole in Orland. Someone came up from below. It was the wizard who remained in the meeting room.

“Hey, what is this… !”

He was unable to speak for a moment as he looked different from what he had expected. jeek exclaimed.

"what's going on?"

“Ah, that! Miss Dwayne! You're doing something like a seizure! It looks very dangerous! Seeing that the defense system is gone, I think the fight is over, so I'm here to ask for help... !”

The cause is too predictable. Zich clicked his tongue and Lyla wrinkled her face fiercely.

“Does it look dangerous?”

“I feel like I’m going to die right now!”

"i See."

Zich immediately threw himself at Orland again. Windur's blade was again blocked by ice.

“Surrender now! You don't even have to worry about your daughter's life!"

“It’s all over when you guys step back!”

Orland ignored Lila's voice. Zich swung Windur in succession. Orland also attacked Zich.

Zich, who was backing away again, who was aiming for Orland's gap, looked back slightly to see if he realized something. A small smile formed on his lips.

Zich rushed to Orland again. It's a movement that doesn't look much different than it has been before.

“It’s the same no matter how many times you do it!”

Orland built a wall of ice.

Quad Duck!

Zich put a lot of magical energy into Windur and broke the ice wall. There was a little gap. Zich half-forced himself into the gap.

“You idiot!”

Whoops!

Ice picks sprout from the wall. It hit Zich. The vital point was avoided, but Zich's body was stained with blood.

“Die that way!”

Orland smiles with joy. He spit out the blood on his lips, and Zich smiled at him.

“You are the one to die, you idiot!”

"what… ?”

Aww!

At that moment, a huge flame split the room. The flame that melted the surrounding ice in an instant cut through Orland's leg, half of his pelvis, and his upper flank.

"uh… .”

Orland rolled to the floor with a small question mark as if in disbelief.

Quajiic

Zich smashed all the ice that had pierced his body. And drank the potion. The holes in the body are gradually filled.

After throwing the potion bottle haphazardly, Zich quietly turned his head to the person who approached him.

There was Wilwes, who had a terribly hardened impression. Holding the mass-produced wand he had picked up nearby, he approached Orland's side. No one made a sound. just watching the scene.

“Whoa! Whoa!”

Orland takes a breath. He could feel how deeply he was in pain through his breath.

Zich looked at Orland's condition.

'If I didn't get treatment, I couldn't live.'

About 1/3 of his body was lost.

“••• Whoo! Right. I forgot you.”

“… You know that I forgot even for a moment as the best wizard in the tower

It’s just proof that you’re stupid.”

“Damn nagging… .”

Orland cursed and turned his eyes to Zich.

“Did you deliberately attack me to divert my eyes?”

“It’s because I’m a bit quick-witted. I knew right away that Matap Master was preparing something.”

“Kit!”

Orland clicked his tongue. His eyes turned to Will Weiss.

“What are you looking at with those eyes, Father? You were the one who ended me.”

“If I hadn’t heard that Elena was in danger, I would have been a little more moderate.”

“You’re a smarter granddaughter than a stupid son, right?”

“I didn’t say that, you foolish son!”

“Son. Now it’s an insulting word.”

Orland's eyes slowly lose focus. It meant he was nearing death.

“… If it is a potion, there is. It is the best among Carwiman's potions.” Zich showed Wilwes a potion. But Wilwes shook his head.

“As long as the situation has reached this point, there is no way this guy can survive even if he saves him right away. Besides, so is that bizarre connection with Elena. I don't know what kind of connection it is, but it could still affect Elena. Usually that kind of connection ends when one of them dies.”

"Is that so."

Zich put the potion back in.

“👑👌👌👌 I don't even care about my son until the end. Don't worry, Dad. I'm sure I stole the talent. Elena is undoubtedly a genius who can be counted among the fingers in the world. The talented blood that my father longed for. So, rest in peace and be happy, Father.”

“•••What you have done is unforgivable no matter what grudges and thoughts you hold. Especially if you have touched your family.”

“No more nagging… .”

"I'm sorry!"

Orland shuts his mouth. Wilwes lowered his head. Something twinkle fell from his eyes


Orland looked into his hazy eyes.

“Really, really… I'm sorry… .”

“••• Twenty years late, goddamn father.”

With those words, Orland's mouth never opened again.

The great incident that wrapped around Snuwick's horse tower came to an end.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 276 screen

Jack opened his eyes. The refreshing morning sunlight is seeping through the windows. Rub your eyes once and stretch your body wide to relieve your stiff body overnight.

'I dreamed of a dog again.'

This dream is never forgotten. Zich got up from his bed and looked out the window.

The first thing that caught my eye was the majestic Snuwick's Horse Tower, which stood majestic in the center of the city. But today is the last time I see it.

Today was the day they left Snoowick.

After Orland's unsuccessful coup, Snoo Week went into turmoil. It must have been a huge event that covered the city tower as well as the city officials.

High-ranking mages related to the coup were arrested one after another, and several prestigious families were also taken away.

But that's the story of the city. It was a problem that had nothing to do with Zich's party.

Of course, in the beginning, quite a few people were called out as related parties, but now that the operation has progressed to some extent, there have been no further calls.

Zich packed up his belongings and left the room.

A wide hallway is visible. They were now in debt to Dwayne. In addition to serving as a hospitality that helped resolve the situation, he made them stay at home until the investigation was over.

It was a fairly comfortable life, but that also ended today.

I went into the drawing room where I was supposed to meet, drank the tea the user gave me, and waited for my colleagues.

“Are you here early?”

Lyla came in. Looking at her frizzy hair and eyes that have not yet fallen asleep, it seems that she has been immersed in her interpretation work until late in the evening.

“Are there any results?”

"so so."

She shuddered at the heat while pouring the tea the user gave her into her mouth. It was due to lack of sleep. Zich laughed out loud and rolled around. Her sharp eyes pierced her, but she didn't care. After he smiled satisfactorily, he wiped away his tears and said.

“I’m happy though. It is rewarding to come to this city.”

The reason they came to Snoowick was that they might be able to get information about Claw One or its characters.

I couldn't find any information on Cloone, but at least I was able to get information about the characters with certainty.

However, the place where he got the clue is only in an unexpected place.

'I don't think the robes know the text of Cloone.'

It seems certain that the robes and the Cloones are related. So how far will that relationship go? Even a group of robes? if not… .

'It could be extended to Gren Jennerd.'

More and more, interest in the existence of Cloone grew.

“When do you think the interpretation will end?”

Jack asked.

“I don’t know that.”

“Even if it’s small, if we have a sample of the text, wouldn’t it be over soon?”

“Of course not. It's because the writing system is just as different as the old country. It will take quite some time to get everything in order.”

"okay."

If it were Laila, then that would be it. Zich decided to wait comfortably.

'It will definitely be released when the time is right.'

“By the way, did you finish it fairly mildly this time? I thought you were going to torment Orland to the end.”

“You must have suffered enough. Because I was full of hope that the top was not far away, and then I fell down.”

“It is, though. However, I think the results are a bit different from what we have so far. I also recommended potions to Master Matap to help you heal Orland.”

“I thought I wanted to tease him a little more, but that might make Elena feel worse. No matter how much he used himself, he is still a father. We didn't have a bad relationship before that."

Human emotions do not only move rationally.

Lyla looked at Zich with a surprised look.

“Did you notice Elena?”

Was there a word nunji in Zich's dictionary?

“I don’t care what he thinks, but you are different. If you look at me in a bad way, it is highly likely that you will naturally feel bad for your colleague as well.”

And that would be a huge blow to Laila, who loves Elena terribly.

“… Did you think of me?”

“First of all, they are colleagues.”

Besides, although she looks good, Lyla is not yet completely free from the shock of the specimen she saw in the ruins.

I have no memory of that, so I have never experienced a close friend rejecting me.

Therefore, the shock of being rejected by Elena could have greatly worsened Lyla's condition.

At the sight of Laila who was surprised and touched with one eye, Ji-Ku smiled with a smirk.

'Well, that's not the only reason.'

There is no need to even say that.

Zich and Lila chatted after that. Meanwhile, Hans and Snock arrived one after the other.

All of Zich's party gathered. Start in this state. But they didn't move.

One was still missing.

“I kept you waiting.”

said Willwes as he entered the drawing room. In the meantime, as if he had been busy with work and suffered a lot, his face had changed quite haggard. But he didn't show his feelings at all.

He turned his head.

“Come on in. I have to say hello.”

"Oh!"

Wilwes forced the person behind him to lead forward. She stepped forward.

She was Elena. Her condition didn't look too good either. There are dark dark circles under the eyes. Considering the circumstances she's been through now, it's only natural.

But she tried to smile.

“I, I, I wish you all the best in the future!” she nods her head

“Thank you!”

Lyla was the first to greet her. After that, Zich, Hans, and Snock also exchanged greetings.

The greeting between each other may be new, but no one thought so.

The present greeting was the first greeting Elena gave as their colleague.

Zich conversed with Wilwess while Lyla inspected Elena's clothes for travel.

“Are you really okay? Even if we send Elena on our trip.”

“Are you uncomfortable?”

“Not at all. Even if it is inconvenient, there is a guy who wants to exclude that opinion completely, so I can’t say it recklessly.”

As Zich pointed to Lyla and spoke, Wilwes gave a small laugh. However, he soon took it seriously.

“That kid has been hurt too much in this city. Just being in Snoowick can stimulate that child's wounds. I'm busy there too, so I can't afford to take care of Elena." His son, Orland, led a coup d'état against Matthew, but to his surprise, Wilwes was able to retain his position as Matthew.

Many families and wizards were involved in this incident, so there was a realistic reason for the lack of staff, and there was also a sympathetic theory that his son had done something disrespectful to his son in any case.

But the biggest reason was that ability.

Everyone recognized that he was the person who could best lead the tower in a time of chaos like now.

But it is also for a while. Perhaps one of the root causes of Orland's rebellion was Wilwes's home schooling, and anyway, he could not prevent this coup in advance, and his responsibilities were considerable, so he would not be able to continue to assume the role of Matap.

It was something that Wilwes himself, as well as the inside of the tower, had already been convinced.

But at least now, there was no time to pay attention to Elena.

In addition, Orland, the only family other than Wilwes, also died this time.

Her maternal grandparents have already passed away, and her relatives are reluctant to entrust Elena.

Besides, whatever the circumstances, my father died at the hands of my grandfather. The influence of the grandfather on the fall of the father is also great.

Of course, Elena's feelings for Wilwes are complicated.

There, Wilwes' answer was to send Elena on a trip with Zich and the others.

“You are Carwiman’s honorary paladin, and Mr. Lyla is a great wizard and loves Elena very much. Above all else, Elena's will was great. It wouldn't be a bad idea to gain a lot of experience during this time." Such various conditions and thoughts overlapped, and Elena went on a trip with Zich's group.

“I’m also quite worried about the Lord Matthew.”

“Fufu, thank you. But these are my karma. I have to deal with it.”

Wilwes looked at the distant mountains with dim eyes. Seeing that scene, Zich remembered the dream he had this morning.

That day too, Leona and Wilwes had a small argument. As always, the other colleagues didn't even care about their quarrels.

After sunset, they camped on a plain.

Siegman, a vigilante, wakes up, leaning on a small burning bonfire and looking at the stars in the sky. A feast of light that seemed to pour out at any moment dazed my eyes.

“Ouch!”

Someone sat down next to Zich. An old, playful, yet unusual voice.

“Aren’t you sleeping?”

“How to lose sleep as you get older

Yes.”

He patted his back exaggeratedly. Jack smiled slightly.

“If you hear that, Leona will laugh at you.”

“So, isn’t that what he does when he’s sleeping?”

He looked at a tent. It was the tent used by Rubella and Leona. Will Wes looked at it with disapproving eyes, but the light inside was warm enough.

“You don’t really like Leona at all.”

“My granddaughter is just that age. Well, elves and humans are completely different ages.”

“… I didn’t know you would admit it right away.”

“Why, did you think you were shy enough to speak up? How old am I to do such a cute thing?”

"but… .”

Judging by his age, he was the tallest person in Zich's party. Although Leona is older, it was unreasonable to ask for her age because of the differences between the races.

“Do you miss your granddaughter? If anything, we can stop by Mr. Wilwess for a while.”

But Wilwes quietly shook his head.

“It’s okay.”

“… You're not happy with your family."

“Did you hear it?”

Zich didn't ask any more. Wasn't he also in a situation where he didn't like his family and left the house? I had no intention of delving deeply into other people's affairs. And Wilwes didn't talk much about his work in the meantime.

But was it because of the magic of the stars that covered the sky? Wilwes looked up at the sky and spoke quietly.

“When I was young, I was ambitious. Position was more important than family, and I thought that my descendants should also be good wizards.”

“You must have had a problem with your child.”

“It was a lot. Eventually, my son left.”

'Where… ' was not asked. It may simply be a run away, or it may have gone a little further.

“Then who is your granddaughter?”

“My daughter-in-law is raising me. a good kid I will raise my granddaughter well enough. Unlike me.”

"Is that so."

“Yes. So, the world in which the daughter-in-law and granddaughter will live should be a little better.”

Zich could understand why the old wizard in front of him was leading the old man and suffering in their party.

A moment of silence passed. Neither of them took their eyes off the stars in the sky.

Jack opened his mouth.

“I don't know what Mr. Wilwes did. And your family doesn't know. So I can't say anything to you in haste. But what is certain is that we will surely be able to make this world a better place to live.”

Wilwes looks at Zich. Zich also looked at Wilwes. A thin arc was drawn on Wilwes's lips.

“… Thank you.”

In a voice completely different from his usual playful voice, Wilwes said so.

did.

Zich woke up from his memory. He turned his head and tried to chase away even a piece of his dream.

'It's a dog dream. It's a dog dream.'

I tried to do that, but the dream was caught in the corner of Zich's head, and he didn't get out of it.

That was one of the reasons why Orland's treatment was a little lenient (?) this time.

Zich is a Brave dream that he hopes to be a dog dream, but it is more likely that it is not a dog dream, and he is confused about Wilwes, one of his colleagues in the dream. So he treated his son a little mildly.

'What happened? It's already over.'

Zich brushed it off.

And now he looked at his party, which had increased by one.

Elena joined the party and stood awkwardly. Lyla smiled at her and chatted, and Now Wet got on her shoulder. coup! making a sound

At least, there seems to be no possibility that Elena will be outside the group. Wilwes also looked at him with satisfaction.

But suddenly his eyes sharpened and he looked at Zich.

“But you really won’t tell me how you got the code for the final defense system of the tower?”

“It’s a secret.”

Wilwes frowned at Zich's words.

“If it wasn’t for either your merit or your deity this time, it would have resulted in death and death.”

"I know. And that's why I put it on Wayne Jawick without hesitation."

Wilwes groaned in pain.

“Don't worry. The password is something you can change, and you won't be able to figure it out anymore. It was only possible once in the first place. I don’t even know what to do anymore.”

“… I hope those words are true.”

But Wilwes had a rough idea.

'Where did you come from?'

It is very difficult to change the password of the final defense system. It is impossible to forcefully change the magic pattern of the magic tower that is already running well. Therefore, it was possible only after activating the final defense system to change the magic pattern of the password.

Wilwes also inherited the code from the previous owner, Matap.

The truth, however, was the exact opposite of what Wilwes thought.

'It was good to know then.' When Zich broke into the tower and destroyed the final defense system by hand, one of his men had the code. The password had already lost its meaning at that time, so it was fairly easy to figure out, the subordinate explained.

'It was nice to remember.'

Because he forgets trivial things quite easily, Zich praised himself to the fullest.

So, having done everything in Dwayne's mansion, they truly left Snoowick. Elena waved to Wilwes with a complicated expression, and Wilwes saw off her granddaughter with a smile, swallowing bitter emotions.

After Snoowick had completely disappeared, Elena sighed for a moment. Then, Lyla hugged her warmly.

How long has it been since Zich and the others started their journey again?

They are reunited with an unexpected person.

"Oh! Mr. Zich! See you here again!”

A woman poking her face out the window of the carriage and greeting Zich. Siek was a little surprised by this unexpected reunion and responded.

“Yes, long time no see, Princess.”

Succubus, Evelynn Rouge, who was Zich's subordinate before returning, was looking at Zich and the party with twinkling eyes.

That was shortly after I left Snoowick.

“Yeah, that’s how you do it.”

Following Lyla's advice and support, Elena moved her magical powers.

Not long after Orland's death, Elena was able to awaken her magical powers.

It wasn't as big as Zich, but Elena's magical power was huge enough. Because of this, she had no choice but to struggle with mana.

However, with her brilliant talent and the help of Lyla, she was able to move some magic a little before she left Snoowick.

The experience of practicing magic with the magical powers of Wet was also helpful.

How long have you been using your magic power since then? At last she had enough magic to move, and she was testing her magic using her magic for the first time.

The magical energy that Elena moved gathers at the tip of the staff. Before Elena left, it was the highest quality wand that Wilwes had prepared.

Is it because it's my first time and I'm nervous? It wasn't a very difficult magic, but sweat was forming on her forehead. However, the magic was completed flawlessly.

"Le! Win! oz! coup! Bjorn!”

Elena started singing. The magical energy is arranged in a texture at the tip of the staff. And after a while.

Whoops!

Flames rose from the tip of Elena's staff.

"Ah!"

Elena stares blankly at it.

It was a very insignificant magic compared to the overwhelming and terrifying magic of Laila and Wilwess, but it was a more enchanting and beautiful flame for Elena than any other magic.

"Teacher! this… !”

“Very well done, Elena!”

Lyla gives a thumbs up to Elena, who sees herself with an expression that lacks reality somewhere. Then I glanced around Zich and the others.

If I don't praise Elena with her sharp eyes right away, I think she'll bite my throat.

"Congratulations. You have finally taken the first step.”

Zich lightly applauded and congratulated him. Hans and Snock also joined in the celebration. It looks like he's glancing at Lyla, but it must be an illusion of his eyes.

"thank you...."

At first he spoke with joy, but as he went on, his voice mixed with moisture. Eventually, she managed to finish her speech and sighed.

How much magic did you want to get? However, thinking about the current situation, tears came more than laughter.

Lyla hugged Elena. The magic didn't disappear any time soon. For a moment like that, Elena's cry flowed around.

Fortunately, Elena's crying did not last long. She voluntarily fell from Lyla's arms.

There was a commotion that Elena was crying with emotion for a while, but it was true that Elena used her magic for the first time today, so they decided to hold a small party under Lyla's initiative.

Because he was homeless, it was impossible to make it glamorous, but it was possible to sit around a bonfire and eat luxurious food.

Evelynn's carriage appeared while they were enjoying the untimely dinner.

If it had been a moving route running through the mountains as usual, we would not have been able to meet him, but it was thanks to Zich's use of the highway this time in consideration of Elena.

Evelynn carefully got off the wagon. And he walked in front of the group. A knight followed her. It was Bfio Riki, Evelynn's escort knight.

As an escort driver, it was not very desirable to see the young lady he serve approaching a traveler who was homeless on the roadside, but Ricky wasn't too nervous either.

The grace that Zich and Laila inflicted on the Marquis of Rouge is by no means light.

Naturally, Ricky also had strong trust in Zich and the others. Besides, even if Zich broke the ties, he wouldn't be the son of Earl Stillwall.

“I never thought we would meet in a place like this.”

“So am I. I hope to see the princess again on a roadside like this. This is not even the Cronon Kingdom, is it?”

Zich's eyebrows lowered slightly.

“Excuse me, but did anything else happen to the Marquis?”

A man from another country, also a high-ranking aristocrat, the young marquise, suddenly appeared in another country. Something happened to her, so Zich asked a little more seriously.

Fortunately, Evelynn patted her hand as if nothing had happened.

"no. There are no stars in the family. The same goes for the kingdom. This time, I am just going on that trip.”

“Are you talking about travel?”

"Yes! I'm on my way to Janmalfi."

Jack was a little surprised.

“This is a coincidence. We were also on our way to Janmalfi.”

“Oh, is it?”

Evelynn's eyes twinkle. It seems that I can already hear the next words.

"Good for you! Then let’s go together!” At Blinn's words, which did not deviate even an inch from his expectations, Zich smirked.

♦ * *

fine blood. It is famous as a city of entertainment. There are plenty of things like plays and operas, as well as bars and casinos.

Literally the best city to eat and play. That place was Zanmalfi.

Evelyn intervened and sat down between Zich and the others who sat around the bonfire. Evelynn's party was also preparing to camp nearby to spend the night here.

“Anyone new?”

Hans and Snock are familiar faces, but Elena sees them for the first time. Evelynn showed her curiosity.

“This is a new kid who joined the party. Lyla is teaching magic.”

"i See. nice to meet you. My name is Evelyn Rouge.”

“It’s Elena Dwayne.”

When Evelynn greeted, Elena responded politely.

Evelynn asked.

“Why are you going to Zanmalfi?”

“Isn’t it a city of entertainment? I thought it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go there just to change my mood.”

To be precise, it was Lyla's request.

Seeing that Elena was still depressed, she asked Zich for advice on what to do, and Zich replied, "Why don't you take him to Zanmalfi?"

As Lyla accepted Zeeke's proposal, the party's destination was naturally set to Joan Malfi.

“Why are you going to Zanmalpi, Princess? Beyond borders.”

“I am just like you. Because of its reputation as a city of entertainment, I’ve been wanting to go there for a long time.”

“The Marquis has given you permission.”

“After that incident, please listen to all my idiots whenever possible. He said he wanted to refresh his mood this time too, so he gave me permission even though he grunted.”

Apparently, Marquis Rouge was under a lot of stress from her daughter's folly.

Seeing her smiling like a prankster who succeeded in pranking, Succubus Evelynn Rouge seemed to be slightly visible, so Zich burst into laughter.

“But if you go alone, Zanmalfi will be a little less fun.”

“That was a concern. But fortunately, I met some friends along the way. It would be really nice if those friends could play together.”

Singing, he alternately looks at Zich and Lyla. Anyone who saw it looked like 'play with me'.

Zich looked at Lyla. going to play anyway. Before returning, Sieg had no complaints about going with his subordinates. And it seemed to be the same with Laila.

“Then do that.”

"Thank you very much!"

When Lyla's permission fell, Evelynn laughed like a child.

Elena, who was watching the scene closely, asked Snock who was next to him quietly.

“Was that person the young marquis?”

"Huh. I am the daughter of the Marquis Rouge of Cronon Kingdom.”

Elena was really surprised. Talking so friendly with the daughter of the marquis. Once again, Zich and Lyla looked great.

“Actually, Zich-sama is also the son of a certain countess.”

" really?"

The conversation continued while Elena continued to accumulate new information.

“But looking for people to hang out with on the road, it seems that a wonderful new meeting has yet to happen.”

Lyla stiffened. I can't help but wonder if it would be better to bring Albus's story out to Evelyn.

Surprisingly, however, Evelynn was not shocked.

"Iknow, right. Although my father and brother showed me portraits of various people, I didn't feel like 'this is this person!' Since that author incident, both of you have been very careful about my love and engagement issues, so I won't rush it."

And Evelynn smiled brightly.

“And do you know? There may be some wonderful encounters in this city.”

“I sincerely hope that will happen.”

“Mr. Zich, please help me a lot.”

"Sure."

How long have you been talking like that? The time has come to go to sleep.

“Then I will return to the carriage.”

“Yeah, see you tomorrow morning.”

Leaving behind Zich and the others who had started preparing well, Evelynn also tried to return to her carriage.

Then, as soon as I thought of something, I took Laila and walked away from the party for a bit.

"What happened?"

“How far did you and Jindo go?”

Laila, who had been a little nervous about whether there was something important to talk about, suddenly loses her energy.

But seeing Evelynn's twinkling eyes seemed to be very important to her.

“I have nothing to do with Zich.”

"Yes? Hasn't progress been made at all since then?"

Evelynn's face flushed with disappointment.

“It’s second to go out, and we don’t even want to stand on the starting line.”

"is that so."

Although disappointed, Evelynn has nothing to say that she is.

“Then, have you found any other men you like?”

“There is nothing like that.”

“Isn’t the man closest to you now, Mr. Zeek?”

“If you ask me, yes.”

“Hmm.”

Evelynn blew her nose.

“Once I got it.”

“•••The word once takes a while.”

“Let’s not worry about the little things. Come on, let's go! It's late, so I'll have to go to bed soon."

Evelynn places her hand on Lila's shoulder and pushes it lightly. Once the story was over, Lyla felt uneasy as she was pushed by Evelynn.

* * *

After joining Evelynn's group, Zich's group continued their journey to Janmalfiro.

Evelynn, whom I had not seen in a long time, was very lively. It seemed that a lot of the resentment towards the man I had seen before had disappeared.

I still shrugged a little when I saw strangers nearby, but it was definitely improved compared to before.

Clearly, Evelynn was flapping her wings vigorously, overcoming the scars of the past, with new wings blooming.

Zich was also quite satisfied with the pleasant appearance. I was very pleased with this accidental encounter.

However, the accidental meeting did not end there.

That was when they arrived in Zanmalfi.

When they crossed the heavy walls and entered the city, they were mesmerized for a moment by the splendid appearance of the city, except for Sieg. To that extent, Zanmalfi was engulfed in splendor and vitality.

I had already seen Zich once before returning, so I wasn't that impressed. Rather, he looked closely at the condition of the city.

'•••I think there are a lot of guards.' It's not that I don't understand. It has a fairly high crime rate as it has a reputation as an entertainment city.

It is a place where your wallet can be stolen three more times a day if you are vigilant. When you think about it, there are many guards and it's not that they don't understand.

'But it seems to be more than I thought.'

However, the people of the city were wandering around in search of their own entertainment, regardless of such things.

“Let’s find a place to stay.”

At Ricky's suggestion, the group finds a place to stay.

entered the city center. Meanwhile, Zich looked around.

It was when his eyes checked a building on the street.

' Huh?'

Zich stopped walking. A familiar man stood on the side of the building. It seems that that person also found Zich.

He sees Zich with his eyes wide open. for a while too. He approached Zich with a bright smile.

“Zeek!”

Zich trembled at this unbelievable coincidence and called out the name of the one approaching.

“Count Dracul.”

He was Joachim Dracul, another of Zich's subordinates before his return.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 278 Tuesday

Sieg and Joachim faced each other. Zich, who looked closely at Yoha Lim, smiled.

“Fortunately, he appears to be in good health.”

Yohaim was tall, but had a slim figure. However, Joheim's appearance today was different from before.

It hasn't changed that I'm skinny, but I've gained quite a bit of weight. The old image of a sick person was far away.

That's why I almost didn't recognize it for a moment. Zich recognized him because he had spent a lot of time with him before his return, so he was very familiar with him.

“I ate hard and exercised. It's not like it used to be where you can live on your own. Oh, of course, that ability is also great.”

“Didn’t you use it?”

"of course. It has moved my blood to the extent that I have used it. I used to move other people's blood a little to know the level of danger, but that's only a few times. I don't want to be a blood-crazed person either." Then he said jokingly.

“So, fortunately, there is no need for Zich-sama to come to punish me.”

In the past, he was referring to the words that Zich himself would put an end to Joheim if he ran out of blood and turned into a monster.

Jack smiled as well.

“That’s good.”

I don't think there's any need to kill his subordinates before returning to do a good deed.

“What's going on in this city, Sir Zich? Did you happen to have access to the information, too?”

"information? I don't know what kind of information the Count came from, but I was just on a trip. Janmalfi is a famous entertainment city.”

"Is that so."

Joachim looked a little disappointed. If Sieg had come to this city with the same purpose as him, he was thinking of asking for cooperation and exchange of information.

“Looks like something is going on.”

"That's right."

Joachim thought for a moment. I was wondering if I could tell Zich this information. But he soon came to a conclusion.

“There is no reason to hide it from Zich-sama. Rather, we can get help from Zeek-sama.”

"what's going on?"

“Those who wear robes. There was information that they were captured in this city.”

"I beg your pardon!"

It wasn't Zich who responded to Joheim's words.

Zich and Joheim's gaze turned to the side. There stood Evelyn, who was getting off the carriage and approaching for some reason.


Zich and Evelynn unpacked in a fairly expensive lodging in the city center.

Zich is short on money, and Evelynn is a young marquise. There was no need to worry about the price of accommodation.

“It's a pretty nice place.”

Joachim entered Zich's room. A knight who had seen him, Broad, was following him.

Zich sat Joachim on the chair prepared. Broad stood tall behind Joachim.

“Isn’t this a great place for the Count?”

“You don’t know the circumstances of our estate. There are a lot of places where money can go, so now I am saving even a penny.”

Joachim's older brother, Biyom, was making a fuss, and the karma of the previous Count Dracule was also tightening the current Dracule estate.

'It's not just that Yeong-ji's situation is bad.'

Relations with the surrounding nobles are probably not very good either. No, not only the aristocrats around him, but the aristocrats in the country as a whole may have been overlooked.

Therefore, in order to maintain the gates, diplomatic efforts will have to be made together.

“Are you having a hard time?”

“It’s okay because we’re making up for it somehow. Fortunately, he was recognized as a count by His Majesty, and we are having conversations with other nobles little by little. Could it be that the light is getting brighter? The critical thing is that no one wants to marry me.”

It's really bad news for aristocrats, but Joheim said it jokingly. It was a really minor issue compared to the other things he had to deal with.

Seeing that, too, with a small smile, replied jokingly.

“That’s a bad thing.”

“It’s a very bad  thing.”

The two laughed out loud.

Then a knock was heard. The person who came in was Evelyn.

Changed into comfortable clothes rather than outdoor clothes, she carefully stepped in. Behind her was Lee Key, an escort agent.

"Excuse me. It seems a little late.”

And then Lyla followed her in. Joachim looked at her.

“Is that the one who killed Lady Baggot?”

“You knew it too.”

“Sir Brod was quite surprised.”

Zich looked at Broad. His gaze turned to Laila, then moved to Zich.

The owner didn't open his mouth because he was having a conversation, but he had a face asking for an explanation right away.

If it's Broad, you've seen Lyla. Of course I was skeptical.

When he saw Lyla, she was very suspicious. It also has the adjective 'very dangerous'.

“For some reason, we decided to travel together.”

“Are you trustworthy?”

“That's enough for me.'

"Is that so. Then make me believe it too.”

Joheim turned his head to look at Broad.

“You say so.”

"all right."

That was the end of it. Joachim turned his head, and Broad continued to escort him with his gaze fixed straight ahead.

“Are you okay with that?”

"That's how much you trust Zee."

“This is very trustworthy.”

Zich shuddered.

Evelynn and Lila sat down on the chairs. Ricky stood behind Evelynn, just like Broad.

Four people sat facing each other with a round table in between. We could chat all night long after a long reunion, but now was not the time for that. People's expressions became serious.

“First, let me introduce myself. My name is Evelynn Rouge, the Marquis of Rouge, Croignon Kingdom.”

Evelynn bowed her head gracefully toward Joachim.

“This is Count Joachim Dracul.”

Joachim also greeted her.

Seeing that scene, Zich looked at him with the feeling that he was looking a little shaky.

Before returning, a human bathing in blood and a man hanging around the neck of a handsome man, the two of them greeted each other with etiquette.

I glanced at Leila. She was also looking at their greetings with an expression that could not be described whether she had the same feelings as Zich. However, as soon as the two of them finished their greetings, they quickly corrected their expressions.

“You were the Count. I’m too young to know.”

"haha! How did it happen? When it came down to it, it wasn’t really that good.” Johaim said kindly. Then I looked at Laila. Although there is a relationship, the two have not been formally introduced.

“You know Lila?”

Zich placed a hand on Lyla's shoulder.

“Yes, I know.”

“It was a lot of rudeness back then.”

Lyla bowed her head.

“It’s okay. You must have something to do with Zich's proof of your identity. If it's okay with you, I'll explain the situation later, and if it's uncomfortable, you don't have to do it."

However, as if to clearly differentiate him from Zich, he did not fully speak to Lyla. It was not strange because they had different statuses.

After the introduction of each other was completed, the conversation began in earnest.

Jack asked.

“I heard that the robes were caught in this city.”

“Before that, can I hear about this, Young-ae Rouge?”

Evelyn answered the question.

“If those guys are trying to take someone down and corrupt them, I’m a victim too.”

“Like the Count, the Princess was also a target for them.”

Joachim looked at Evelynn with a startled look. Evelynn had a very startled face as she did not know that Joheim was the same target as her.

“•••You are the same victim. Then it's good enough to hear the story."

Joheim began to explain in earnest.

“I am sorry to say this from the beginning, contrary to expectations, but nothing has been confirmed yet. It is now at the stage of doubt.”

“That alone is worth a listen.”

“Well then. Since that incident, I have been constantly looking for those in robes. I had to take revenge and restore the honor of the family. First of all, I checked to see if there were any unusual events in the realm of the kingdom.”

It wasn't easy. It is to find the case that may or may not exist while cleaning up the messed up estate.

But he persevered and pushed forward. How long to find and comfort the non-cooperation and vigilance of other nobles?

“You have found an unusual case in this city.”

"That's right."

I see Brod nodding his head behind Joheim. It seems that Joheim's achievements were very bold.

“There are missing cases in this city right now.”

“It’s missing. But doesn’t that happen in any city?” This world is not at peace. Even if the Age of Magic had not yet come, the world was rough enough.

“It is. But the missing people have something in common.”

“What do you have in common?”

“They were lovers.”

“Lovers?”

It's definitely special if it's special.

“Are there any requests for money or anything like that?”

"There is not. One of the lovers goes missing, as if they were cut to the ground. Disappearing people do not discriminate between men and women. Just one remains and one disappears.

NS."

« O ”

Jack patted his chin.

“So I started to focus on this city. Fortunately, the Earl of Yeong-ji, to which this city belongs, is a very close friend of my father. As an opportunity to restore my honor, you gladly entrusted me with the investigation of this case.”

Of course, as long as they are lords and lords, it will not be one-sided giving grace to each other.

'Perhaps there is a feeling of letting go of a troublesome incident. If Joachim sets the ball, he'll think about sharing it appropriately.'

However, no matter what, he had the nobles of other territories search his territories. It was also clear that the friendship was great.

“And recently, there have been reports that they may have seen a suspicious man wearing a robe.”

“  They really were there!”

Evelyn said. But Sieg and Joachim shook their heads.

“It’s too early to be sure, Princess. Hearing the Count's story, it's just a tip that he seems to have seen it all the way. Besides, the ones in robes aren't the only ones we're looking for. Guys with their backs usually wear robes to hide their identity.”

Just like Zich puts on his robe whenever he infiltrates somewhere.

“Zeek-sama is right.”

"i See."

Even Joachim agreed, and Evelynn was completely dead.

“But it's worth a look.”

Jack laughed. I don't know how likely it is, but there's a chance there are robes.

'Never just can't get over it.'

Their plans have to be ripped, crushed, and trampled on to make the best of it.

Zich said to Joachim.

“I also want to cooperate with the Count.”

"If Zich-nim helps me, I'm relieved."

"I! I'll help too!"

Evelyn intervened. Ricky was terrified, but he couldn't break Evelynn's will.

“Please at least use the escorts I brought with me. The sin of threatening my family by having my ex-fiance dared to do so is unforgivable!”

“Then the conversation is almost over.”

Zich said while making eye contact with the three of them.

“Let’s look for them, and if they really exist, we will trample them down with care.”

(Continued on next page)

# No. 279 Tuesday

The day after digging into this case, we vigorously agreed to annihilate all robes if they were involved.

Despite the agreement of the previous day, Sieg and his party were absorbed in their sightseeing.

After watching one of the city's most popular plays at the moment, having lunch at a good shop, and now hanging out at the casino.

“… Is this okay?” Lyla asked suspiciously.

She took off her usual comfortable travel clothes and wore a light dress. This is because the casino is a rather luxurious place, so at least a minimum of attire was required.

It's not even a great dress. Although it is priced, it is definitely inferior to the clothes people wear here.

However, there is only one unchanging principle of fashion.

Face.

Although she is light, she absorbs the attention of the people around her no matter what she wears, but when she appeared dressed up, she literally monopolized the gaze of the people around her.

It's not for nothing to say that Zich is the most beautiful person he's ever seen.

I don't know how many people have tried to approach her so far. But she was resolutely shoving her approach.

"Huh? What did you say?"

Zich, who was pushing the chip onto the table, turned his head. Anyone who sees it is not obsessed with gambling and not listening. It was the same with Zich, who wore formal attire.

The suit that was pulled out tightened the body, and the hair that was usually messy was now neatly organized.

Then the aristocratic appearance that had been hidden in his light demeanor and tone was revealed. After all, he was the eldest son of a high-ranking aristocrat, the count.

Besides, he's not quite as non-human as Lyla, but he's also considered handsome enough.

At least, as a man who had a relationship with Lyla, he was able to block other men's access to some extent.

“Is this okay?”

“Is it because of the investigation?”

“Otherwise, what would it be?”

Zich places the card in front of him. His face frowned.

“Eight!”

I threw a card and got up. It was the moment when possession of his bets passed to the casino.

“Yeah, did you ask about the investigation?”

“If you make me say the same thing one more time, be prepared.”

"okay okay."

As if surrendering, Zich raised his hands.

“I will do an investigation. But there's no rush. To be honest, there is nothing I can do right now.”

It's at the level of doubt that the robes still exist.

“After all, you came to this city for sightseeing. The other guys were pretty excited too. It's okay to cool your head for a few days. Above all, you were the one who asked me to come to this city.”

“It is, though.”

“Besides, I'm not wandering around. I'm learning the geography of the city and checking to see if there's anything suspicious. It's not like you're just playing around with it."

“… Aren’t you too addicted to gambling for that?”

“No, you really won’t lose by one shot. Feeling really unlucky at the end of the day. If I do it a little more, I think I will find the original one, so why don’t you do it?”

sigh once. It is a bonus to grab your head if you have a headache. It just felt like a woman struggling with an immature boyfriend.

“Anyway, did you spend all the money you set aside?”

"okay. That’s the last one.”

Contrary to Laila's concern that she would gamble a little more, Zich turned around coolly.

He has a high level of magic and swordsmanship, but his mental strength is just that great. There was no way I could fall into the addiction of gambling. To him, the casino was literally just a place to hang out.

“You don’t?”

“I have no idea.”

“Then let’s find other guys.” He gave Hans, Snock, and Elena some money to surprise and release them. The two started walking shoulder to shoulder together.

“But are you weak at gambling? Are you not using your abilities?”

“Because there are various verification devices. Of course, I can fool enough of those things, but if that's the case, what do you gamble for? Competing only for luck without anything is the magic of gambling.”

“I don’t understand.”

Avoid people wandering around and find others in moderation. Then I heard a table buzzing.

Zich and Lyla looked in that direction.

“Are you Elena and Snok?”

With the exception of Lila, the person Elena feels most comfortable with is Snock.

It was probably because they were with us when we borrowed the magic of the same age. So when she left Lyla, Elena tended to move with Snock.

Because of that, it wasn't always unusual for the two to stick together. The real surprise was the coins piled up like a mountain in front of them.

“Are those guys all other things?”

“I think so?”

Snock and Elena also looked at the coins piled up like a mountain in front of them, and they were hardened.

“Isn’t it possible that he cheated with his powers or something?”

“Don't underestimate the detection capabilities of casinos. They can fool as much as I do, and they have no choice.”

“Then, did you really win with your skills?”

“It must be beginner’s luck.”

Then cheers erupted from the other tables as well. Naturally, their eyes turned to that direction this time.

“Are you Hans?”

“It’s Hans.”

Coins are piled up in front of Hans, who seems to be playing alone.

“I think he got it too.”

" Right."

Lyla tapped Zich's elbow.

“Are you the only one who actually lost money?

“Uh… .”

Unlike before, Zich's eyebrows lowered angrily. Seeing this, Laila laughed out loud.

* * *

Hans, Snock, and Elena won a lot of money. However, when the coins were exchanged for cash, the heat of Hans and Snock subsided.

I couldn't feel it when I was in coin. It looked great when it was just full of fancy round chips.

However, when it became cash, its value clearly entered my mind.

It's obviously a lot of money, but the money I gave them to spend when they need it isn't too much. The same goes for Elena. Isn't she the rich lady?

“Isn’t this the face of someone who stole money from the gambling house?”

“Leave it. Let’s see if they have their own inspiration.”

“There are people who can’t feel that excitement alone, right?”

Lyla said with a smile.

It seems that he wants to relieve the anger that he usually suffered. But as of today, Zich had nothing to say.

“Everyone is here.”

Someone approached the group who had gathered. It was Evelyn. She, too, was walking around on the tour of Zich's group. Ricky was close behind her, escorting her.

“Did you have fun?”

Jack asked. Evelyn's reaction was lukewarm.

"well. I was really looking forward to it, but it wasn't to my taste.”

“It would be better. It gets really serious when you get addicted to gambling. If you lose, it’s also a good way to brush up on what you lose.”

“No, I picked it up. Still, it's not much fun... .”

Jack closed his mouth. Lila patted her on the side from the side.

By the time they left the casino, it was already full of stars. They started going back home.

The means of transportation was a wagon. Evelynn's carriage was quite large, so Zich and his party could all sit comfortably.

They were talking a lot about today's tourism.

Most of the story begins with Evelynn. It was the form that other people responded to from time to time.

However, the conversation was not interrupted and flowed quite peacefully.

It was then that a sudden scream was heard.

The sound they heard was small, as if it was a scream from quite a distance. But even Evelynn, who had never been trained, could hear the car.

A long scream mixed with weeping. The faces of the people in the carriage hardened at the same time.

Bump!

Zich immediately opened the carriage door.

“Lyla, Elena. You protect the princess and go home as is. Hans, Snock. You come along.”

Zich jumped out of the carriage. After that, Hans and Snock also jumped out of the wagon.

fault!

He runs through the city with his legs full of magical power. Sieg and Hans stepped on the roofs of the city and moved as if flying in the sky.

A huge figure followed them behind them. It was Know Wet who changed his body enormously. Sharp claws and creepy teeth are a threat.

However, if you look closely, the cuteness of when you were small remained here and there. Snock was riding on Norwet's back.

They really sprinted over the city. The target was in the direction the scream was heard.

'No more screams.'

Not good. When the scream is over, it usually means two things.

Either the screaming situation has been resolved, or the screaming no longer exists.

Moreover, no matter how much Zich, he cannot pinpoint the exact location with a single scream.

Once the feeling is fully unfolded. You can't help but keep moving and hope something specific happens.

'Is this?'

A sign is detected. no movement

'It's not dead.'

It doesn't look like he was seriously injured.

'Did you simply lose your mind?'

Once I found a person like that. Zich headed to the place where he could feel the presence.

They arrived in a back alley. It's not far from the street. However, surprisingly, there are many places where the atmosphere of a city changes completely if you go over a few blocks.

I see one person lying down. was a woman Zich turned her down as she lay down. Put your finger on your nose.

'Breathing is normal. There are no visible injuries.'

He must have been shocked and lost his mind. But just in case you don't know, I'll give you a potion first. And shook her to wake her up.

Hans and Snock stepped down behind Zich. Knowwet immediately turned back into a small body and mounted it on Snock's shoulder.

“ o uh ''  T that •

The woman's consciousness slowly awakens.

“Are you out of your mind?”

The woman, who had been unconscious for a while despite Zich's question, immediately opened her eyes.

I glanced around, saw Zich, screamed a little, and pulled me back.

Zich didn't approach her hastily. Rather, he took a few steps back and distanced himself.

“I have heard screams. Could it be that you are the one who screamed?”

“… Ah!"

The vigilance in her eyes softens a little.

“No, that’s right.”

“May I ask what happened here?”

"what… Work… ?”

Slowly, she remembered what had happened before she fainted. she opened her eyes

Completely different from when she left before, she hurriedly approached Zich. And grabbed the hem of his sleeve.

“He,  him… !”

she screams desperately.

“Fran! Please save my lover!”


A security guard appeared out of nowhere in a back alley. He takes a torch and sweeps the back alley.

Their determination not to miss even a single clue is evident throughout their movements.

Unfortunately, there were no clear results.

Zich, Hans, and Snock were watching it from a distance. Even between the security guards, a person walks out. He was Joachim, reunited in the city.

His hard face reflected his feelings as it was.

“How are you, Count?”

To Sieg's question, Johaim answered heavily.

“It seems that the disappearance we are looking for is correct.”

Zich looked at the scene. A victim was sitting nearby, talking to a soldier.

She continued to let out a low-pitched cry, as if she had not yet calmed down. The sound crawled through the ground and pierced the people's ears precisely.

Every time the eyes of the people around her pass by her, it changes with pity.

Of course, Zeek was an exception. Rather, it would be strange if now and he felt sympathy for a woman crying.

Therefore, he focused on catching the criminal.

“Tell me the exact situation.”

“It was a situation where that woman was going home after a date with her lover.”

Although it was late, there were quite a few people walking around even after the sun went down due to the nature of the city of Zanmalfi. For them, at least a lot of lights were placed along the street.

However, it is natural that there are fewer people compared to the daytime.

“But suddenly a strange shadow came over from the alley.”

“A shadow?”

"Yes. A woman expressed it that way. They said it was a shadow, or pitch black darkness. They say it swept them and dragged them into the alley.”

pitch black darkness. If the robes are involved, it must be mine-related.

'  Is there anyone like  that?'

However, there is no Mine that comes to mind clearly. For now, Zich decided to continue listening to the explanation.

“It is said that the shadow dragged them deep into the alley. But suddenly the shadows said that the woman had let her go.”

“Let me go?”

“I can only think of it that way. Women are just ordinary people. But the man said he wouldn't let it go. The woman screamed and desperately grabbed the man's sleeve, but suddenly received a strong shock to the back of the head. And when I woke up, Zich was right in front of me.”

“Did you ask about the shadows?”

“I asked, but it seems like he doesn’t know the details. In the first place, even calling it a shadow is a way for women to express themselves. It might be something entirely different. We will have to do more research.”

Now she is very excited. If you calm down, you may be reminded of something different. But neither Sieg nor Joachim thought that the possibility was very high.

“Is this the first time the criminal has been revealed?”

"That's right. So far, I have only guessed that there are people who kidnap lovers based on the circumstances.”

But now that the bizarre criminal has appeared directly, Joachim's conjecture has come to life a little more. Maybe the robes are really involved in this city.

However, Joachim's expression was not so good.

Because the increase in the chances they gained was accompanied by the harm of others.

The woman's crying still didn't stop.

Zich looked at the scene. He saw the police looking for evidence, but Zich shook his head.

'There is no reverberation of magical power, and there are no special traces.'

You probably won't find anything there. Zich left the scene with Jo Haim and went back to his dorm.

* * *

After that, the raids continued. The frequency of kidnappings has increased, and the behavior has become more daring, as if arguing that the abductions were rare and secretive.

On one occasion, he attacked two lovers at the same time. There, the criminal kidnapped a man and a woman, one each. Of course, the man and woman were lovers of different people.

As the situation became so, the atmosphere of the city gradually darkened. The number of people walking outside has steadily decreased.

“I think you heard a voice.”

Seeing Joheim entering the room, Zich said. He recognized the embarrassment on Joheim's face. Yoha Lim smiled bitterly.

“I can’t help it. He trusted me to save my honor, but the case is not resolved and is getting worse.”

Joheim pulled out the rest of the chair and sat down. Evelynn looked at him with concern.

“Still, you are too much. The Count is also working hard.”

“Thank you, young Rouge. Although I heard a shout, I did not receive any insults or reprimands. Rather, it is more of an encouragement. Still, it is true that the spirit of the spirit became uncomfortable. Let’s see how to fix it.” There was a firm determination in Joheim's voice.

No matter how little the atmosphere is resolved, Joachim and Count Dracule are not in a very good position now.

Therefore, the relationship with the few who support them is more important than ever.

However, if he can't solve this problem, and his relationship with the lord of this territory who is still supporting him is broken, it will be a huge blow.

Joheim really had to risk his life to solve this situation.

However, resolution alone cannot solve the problem. That's why Joachim stopped by Sieg's dorm every day.

“Did you get any clues?”

With anticipation, Joachim looks at the people in the room.

Four people who always get together. Zich, Lyla, Evelynn and Yoheim. It's a really unique combination.

However, Joheim had high expectations for this combination. Above all else, there is a Zich in this combination.

However, the reply that came back was not cool.

“Not much.”

"•••Is that so."

Joachim couldn't hide his disappointment at Sieg's answer.

They wanted to enjoy sightseeing for a little bit, but they didn't think about it until after seeing the incident in front of their eyes.

No, Zich didn't care, but it was Hans and Snock who saw the victim crying sadly, and Laila, Elena, and Evelynn who heard about it.

So they jumped right in to solve the case.

Knowing that, Joachim also always came at this time to get information.

However, there have been no clear clues so far.

It's just that the criminal uses what might be called shadow or darkness.

'I can't remember such a magician.'

Lyla didn't even remember. Of course, Lyla's memory is incomplete, and Zich doesn't remember trifles.

Literally, this mine may have been so sloppy that it could not occupy a part of Zich's memory.

'Still, if they were like that, something on one side of their brain would tickle them.' lover kidnapper. and shadows. When these two clues were combined, nothing came to mind.

'Well, okay. Because I simply couldn't remember.'

Once you meet, you may remember. If you kill it, you might remember it. And if you can't remember, that's all.

“Then we will have to continue our search for now.”

All I can do now is search.

“But in the meantime, there will be more victims.”

Evelyn sighed.

“Are there any more clues?”

“Until now. However, it is noticeable that the criminal’s movements have suddenly changed.”

As Joheim said, the criminal's method suddenly changed.

From the method of kidnapping one of the lovers without being detected by anyone, the method of attacking the lovers when they are together and kidnapping one person.

said Jack.

“There must be a reason. Whether it is an external cause or a simple psychological change.” However, the reason for this was not clearly expected.

Then Evelyn spoke up.

“How about this?”

Everyone's eyes turned to Evelynn.

“It’s to lure criminals.”

“How do you mean?”

asked Joachim.

“Isn’t the culprit raiding lovers, even lovers walking at night? Then, wouldn't it be a problem if we lure lovers here too?"

That's a valid word. Because of the incident, there were fewer people in the city, and fewer people were attacked by criminals.

This means that if the perpetrator continues to raid, the chance of getting caught in a trap increases.

“That sounds like a pretty good idea. I'll have to ask the mayor of the city to pick some talented people to secretly act as lovers."

“At the same time, I think it would be good for us to put people in.”

“On our side?”

“There are people who fit the role.”

Evelynn looked at Zich and Lyla alternately.

" Yes'?"

Lyla made a stupid noise. Jig also blinked his eyes. However, unlike the two, Joachim seemed very satisfied with Evelynn's opinion.

"i See. The two of you have talent, and since you have traveled together, you should be able to show off the atmosphere like a couple.”

"•••what?"

Zich's words, as if forcibly squeezing out his voice, were not heard by Joheim and Evelynn.

And so… .

“… What the hell is this?”

It was just the two of us that ended up on the side of the road. In the name of a date to lure criminals.

* * *

Janmalfi is basically a glamorous tourist city. There is a lot to play and a lot to see. A very ideal place for a date.

But, it also shines when you have a lover. There was never, at least now, for the sweet element of lovers to enter between Zich and Laila.

“•••But you have to do it first.”

said Leila, half-abandoned. Evelynn's ideas aren't bad. The problem is that I have to pretend to go on a date with Zich.

But Lila has no memory. There is no such trivial thing as a dating method in the knowledge you have.

“I’ll leave it to you, Zich.”

"what? Do you want me to lead?”

“Do you remember when we first met? Then you do it all.”

If it's their first meeting, they're talking about when Laila killed Lady Baggott in Dracul's estate.

'It turned out that such a thing happened.'

I remember recommending a date when I was surprised and attacked her, who knew the demon king of power, Siegmore.

Of course, it wasn't really a dating recommendation. It was nothing more than a sarcastic twist on the words to simply be caught.

But Zich nodded.

"great! If you say so, I'll take the lead! Come to think of it, there's no way you've ever had any dating experience. That's what I'm doing.”

Zich took a step forward with confidence.

“Don’t worry, Lyla. Trust only me! I'm sure you'll get your first date experience!"

“Yes, I will.”

And after a while, Lila took a deep breath.

“… You are like that.”

Lyla looked at Zich with a cold gaze as he threw the card, losing a pile of chips.

“Oh, damn it. My luck is really bad  .”

Not long after entering the casino, Zich, who had blew up quite a lot of money, got up from his chair, grumbling.

“… Is this a date?”

"Huh? of course. what is a date A date is a date for lovers to do fun things with each other, right?”

And he chuckled at the gambling table where he had just lost his money.

“How fun is gambling.”

“Yeah, that’s right.”

Lyla gave up further rebuttals.

“Come on, enjoy yourself. There are few games that can be learned as quickly as the original gambling. It’s the seed money, I’ll give you some.”

He grabs Lyla's shoulder and leads him to the gambling table. All I'm going to do here is gamble anyway.

She meekly intervened in the plate as Zich intended.

“•••So you've been gambling all day?”

Sieg couldn't understand the absurd gaze on him.

"Yes. But even though we went on a date so hard, the culprit did not come. It is not easy to get results in one day.”

No one spoke to Zich's words. It's not like I'm impressed.

Lyla's small sigh resounded.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 281 screen

“… Mr. Zich. Have you ever been on a date?”

“That is of course… !”

Zich, who was trying to answer Evelynn's words with certainty, was speechless.

When I was in the family before my return, I was not interested in women because I was caught in the eyes of my father and was training. After leaving the family, he was busy surviving, and by the time he gained strength, he was already competing with the world.

I've definitely never done anything like walking the streets romantically with a lovely lover hahahaha.

“••• Come to think of it, I've never been on a date like people think.”

I've had a lot of dates full of blood and flesh, screaming and shouting, and taking lives.

“But, what’s wrong with a date? It’s okay if your lover plays while doing something fun.”

“Mr. Zeek is right. Why would someone you know so well spend all day gambling in the casino?”

“Isn't gambling the most fun thing in this city? I do things that I enjoy doing with my lover. Kya ~ ! There is no other date more meaningful than this.”

shameless words don't work Evelynn was also slowly feeling the way Zich was doing that many people had already felt.

“•••It seems inappropriate to leave Sieg on a date.”

“•••It seems so.”

Joachim also agreed with Evelynn. Because the grace they received was grace, they were two people who had a great affinity for Zich, but this was not the case.

Turning away from Zich, who grumbled at the incomprehensible criticism, Evelynn looked at Lyla.

“I think Lyla should take the lead.”

It seems that she did not give up on the imitation of the two lovers.

“Ah, but I’ve never been on a date either.”

“Yes, I know.”

Wasn't it Laila who seemed to be unaware of the feeling of love, let alone dating?

“So, let me tell you about a date course. Lyla can follow that course.”

"•••okay. I'll give it a try.”

“Mr. Zich, please tune in to Ms. Lyla thoroughly.”

Zich, dissatisfied with his dating course not being recognized, nodded reluctantly.

“I will pay for the date here. It's a mission for the city, so we have to pay for it. Still, it would be difficult to subsidize Ziek's gambling expenses.”

When Johaim spoke, Lyla supported her.

“Of course it is. If you support me with the money I lost in the casino, I'm sure he'll spend it happily on the gambling board."

“You talk badly”

However, as a Zich who lost a lot of money today, it was difficult to refute Lyla's words.

“Still, the cost was subsidized. Count's situation is not so good.”

“It’s a deaf ear. However, we can provide enough support for that level of support. Besides, I heard that you lost a lot of money today, wouldn't it be hard for you?”

“The money is quite a lot. There… .”

Zich looked at Lyla.

“Because Lyla won more than I lost.”

The eyes of others turn to Laila. Lyla shrugged. And he spit it out towards Zich as if contemptuously.

“Why do you go to casinos that can’t even make gambling dirty?”

"Damn it."

Jack couldn't respond properly.

Second day of operation. Today is a day to imitate a date according to the course Evelynn devised. In Lyla's hand was a piece of paper written by Evelynn.

However, I thought the course was simply written down, so the thickness of the paper was just right.

Lyla looked at the paper seriously.

“Let’s eat rice first.”

“That’s good.”

Anyway, it's time to eat lunch, so I'm quite hungry.

Zich, who was looking for a place to eat nearby, found a shop. The store was nothing special.

“Shall we go over there?”

"No."

Lyla objected.

“What, what else do you want to eat?

Do you have one too?”

At Zich's question, Lila opened the paper Evelynn gave her again. Then I alternately looked at the paper and the surrounding shops.

"excuse me."

Lyla pointed a finger at a store.

It was a pretty cool shop. From the signboard, there was a lot of attention paid to tea. The interior seen through the open door was also good.

“Let’s go over there.”

“Did the paper say to go to that store?”

“The image of that store is the closest.”

“Hmm.”

Dating depends on a person's taste.

'This is Evelynn's taste.'

It is a shop full of tastes of Evelynn, who dreams of romantic love. Evelynn, who first came here, wouldn't have recommended this shop herself.

As Lyla said, it is clear that Lyla had found the condition Evelynn had written down.

“Okay, let’s go in.”

Today is the day to tune in to Laila, who follows Evelynn's advice. Besides, there is also a pretty good smell coming from inside the shop. Zich followed Lyla's advice.

As soon as you enter the store, you can feel the atmosphere of the store in earnest. Should it be pink?

It was a store for lovers who came to the city to play. All the guests sitting at the table looked like a couple.

At first glance, the store seemed to have been chosen properly. Sit at the table and order food. The price was quite expensive, but considering it was a tourist attraction, it was a reasonable price.

As Zich and Laila were chatting lightly, the food began to come out. The smell that spreads along with the hot steam stimulates the appetite. Zich just picked up the tableware and tried to eat.

"Wait a minute."

Lyla stopped. She glances at the paper Evelyn gave her. And listened to the dishes. I poured a lot of the stew that came out. and held out

" Ah."

Zich rolled his eyes. It was really a moment when Zich was embarrassed for the first time in a long time. However, when he saw Laila's expressionless face, he noticed the situation.

“Is that also Evelynn’s order?”

“ O  ”
“O’.

it was too Zich laughed and ate the stew. The taste was quite good. It seems that the material was used as well.

Lyla pointed to Zich's tableware.

“You do it too.”

Zich also filled the stew and brought it to Lyla. Lyla takes it and eats it.

It's been quite some time since I've traveled with Laila, but this is a different experience. Zich looked at Lyla's face.

No matter how much someone ordered it, it is a very manly act. Perhaps you are blushing with shame and shame. Laila's expression like that was well worth a look.

But Zich's hopes were shattered in vain.

'No change.' Rather than showing a sweet and sweet expression like shame or shyness, it seems like he is seeing a general who is facing a big battlefield right away. She chewed the stew hard, staring intently at the paper Evelynn had given her.

Seeing that, Zich smiled cheerfully.

'Evelynn, I don't think the picture you want will come out again this time.'

Things worked out as Zich had expected.

Lila continued to act quite strangely. It was something that even a normal couple was shy about, at least not reluctant to do outdoors.

However, there was nothing sweet about love in Laila's face when she was acting like that. Rather, he is like a monk who silently carries out his duties. Or some kind of machine.

Zich and Lyla received the attention of those around them. At first, it wasn't just that they didn't look like they were just watching a cool and pretty couple's chicken-raising behavior, but now it's completely different.

With a little bit of exaggeration, it was such a sight to see a bizarre monster that I had never seen before.

No matter how concessions they make, they don't look at their lover.

Zich was quite enjoying this gaze. But it wasn't Lila. It was evident that he was so absorbed in his mission that he had no idea what he looked like.

So the meal was over.

"let's go!"

Lila got up from her chair. In her hand, the paper Evelyn had given her was held tight as if it were a Bible from God. Zich follows Lyla too.

la woke up

I walk out of the store and glance at other people.

Eyes are still attached. Still, it wasn't the way he looked at his lover.

* * *

“So it seems like a failure.”

As Zich spoke, Evelynn grabbed her head. Next to her, Lyla glances at her. I followed the instructions on the paper diligently, but I realized that something was wrong.

“•••Is it a failure to imitate your lover?”

“If you can see it as a lover, I think that would be a great person.”

In a mental ideal way.

Zich's words were wedges.

“… It seems that this mission is not suitable for Zich and Lyla-sama.”

Evelynn had no choice but to agree with Joheim's opinion.

“Fortunately, the mayor also saw Rouge Young-ae's plan quite well. He says he's picking out a couple of camouflaged lovers for the city. Let's trust them.”

“Is there no other way to do that?”

It's a pitiful struggle, but Evelynn nodded her head.

Then Jack said.

“Let’s put Snock and Elena in.”

“The  two?”

Lyla asked surprised.

“They are friendly, but not lovers.”

Looking back, it wasn't long after we met. But Zich shrugged.

“That’s also true of relying solely on the city’s support.”

“It is not. But are they both okay?”

“You don’t necessarily have to pretend to be a lover like us. They'll be very awkward, too. Just ask them to go sightseeing as friends. Just walking around the tourist spots with just two men and women flirting can make you look like a lover to someone you don't know. Isn't it that easy?"

“  Why couldn’t you two do that  easy thing?”

“That’s it, Princess. I think we had a good enough date with that. Criminal standards are very strict. How romantic is a casino date?”

“I did everything I was told.”

“I think it would be better to just think about the future, Rouge Youngae.”

As Joachim said. Evelynn clearly realized that she couldn't stand them both.

“•••Then tomorrow is Mr. Snock and Dwayne.

I'll leave it to Mr.

That's how the meeting of the day ended.

next day. Snock and Elena stood blankly in the middle of the road. A mission I received suddenly in the morning.

play in janmalfi As warm, pleasant and friendly as possible.

It is an important task, so it is a task given to the two who are very nervous. And the two were kicked out by Zich and Laila.

It's pocket money and you get a lot of money.

“… What kind of situation is this, you know?”

coo?

I asked Knowwet, but he doesn't seem to know about this situation either. Then there is only one person to ask. Snock looked at Elena.

“You said that the teacher and Mr. Zich failed to pretend to be lovers. I think we have taken on that role.”

Also a magician. Elena calmly solved Snock's curiosity.

“Then we should pretend to be lovers?”

"maybe."

“••• I don’t think I can do that?”

"So do i."

Die with a Pickaxe in the Mine Han Snok and the two people who sold only the magic book to try and use magic somehow, there is no way that they can imitate a date skillfully.

“Still, the fact that the teacher entrusted it must mean something.”

Elena, who admires Laila very much, did not want to disappoint her. How do I pretend to be a true lover?

But Snock cut her thoughts.

“Well, what am I going to do after thinking deeply? You have to do what they tell you to do.”

“Wait a minute. Still, I need to think a little more and move... !”

“If there had been such a thing, he would have given it a separate word. If they didn't, it would literally mean that it was enough to follow their advice.”

Snock reached out to Elena, who was rubbing her eyes.

“Let’s move. You have to play splendidly for something like this.”

Elena nodded quietly. So the two of them started enjoying the city.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 282 screen

As Snock and Elena roamed the city, Zich and Lyla watched them play from a distance. If the culprit appeared, I was going to jump right in.

However, Hans was nowhere to be seen. Judging that Zich and Lyla alone were enough power to catch the criminal, Zich turned Hans to an investigation into the city.

So Hans was walking around the city, looking intently for anything suspicious.

"Huh?"

Hans, who came out of a small piece of cloth across the city beyond the business district, raised his doubts.

Several stone bridges were built along the well-maintained riverbank. I saw a woman standing on one of them.

'That woman

A woman who puts her arms on the railing of a bridge and stares blankly at the flowing cloth. She was a familiar woman. I didn't see it wrong. Red hair, as if on fire, was a definite characteristic of her.

'Mr. Browning?'

It was clear that she had met at Violuwin before.

It wouldn't be strange for her to be called an acquaintance, even if they only knew each other, but Hans approached her because the old conversation remained in her memory.

He was a talented person, so he may have discovered something strange in the city.

It was time for him to talk lightly.

Startle!

Lara put her hand on the handle of the sword and turned around. Hans took a step back and raised both hands lightly.

Sreung!

Lara's sword was half pulled out.

"Who is it!"

Although there seems to be no will to fight, the approach of a stranger is of course suspicious. Lara's eyes were full of vigilance.

“Calm down. I have no intention of fighting. Have you ever seen him before?” Lara scanned Hans's face with a suspicious look.

There were many men who chattered when she was walking alone, with her outstanding appearance.

Asking where I've seen them before was one of the common repertoires that just men spit out.

However, Lara's vigilant gaze soon disappeared.

"you are… !”

It was a brief meeting, but Lara remembered Hans. The conversation at that time was quite memorable for her as well.

“Fortunately, he seems to remember. Can I put my hands down?”

"Ah yes! Please!"

Lara hurriedly put the sword in. Hans lowered his hand.

“I never thought we would meet in this city.”

“So do I.”

“Are you here for sightseeing?”

“For now, yes.”

But Lara's expression was strange. That wasn't a good look.

'It's not a tourist's face.'

Then I saw that her side was empty. I've only met her a few times, but every time I've met her, I can't see anyone who's attached to her.

“Did you say Mr. Gren Jennard? Didn't he come with you?"

Lara's expression got worse. Until recently, I was just trying to pretend to be a calm expression, but now even that disguise has been broken.

At a glance, it was clear that she was in a bad mood because of that.

“••• We came together. Right now, I’m working a little farther away.”

"i See."

Hans only nodded, but did not dig further.

There is no need to touch another person's painful part for nothing. Besides, I don't think I have a great relationship with her.

But I didn't want to continue this awkward atmosphere.

“You haven’t released your sword yet.”

Obviously, she was contemplating whether it would be better to put the sword and refine her fighting style with a shield.

She was still holding the shield, but it wasn't that big and the sword was a sword she had seen before, so she could tell that she hadn't changed her fighting style yet.

Just a word to change the topic. It was just a few words that could spark a lot of discussion between the two of them.

However, contrary to Hans' intention, Lara's expression worsened even more. Hans' embarrassment also increased.

'Hey, what should I do in this case?' No matter how much he changed, it was only his own powerlessness. Still, interpersonal relationships and social life haven't changed much at Hein Hans. The ability to respond to such situations is bound to decrease.

'Hey, let's praise him first!'

Don't people feel good when they get compliments?

“If I hadn’t let go of the sword, I think my skills would have improved. Even the people I serve have told Mr. Browning that he has talent.”

“•••If you are serving, are you referring to someone who had a conflict with Gren? The honorable paladin you said...”

"Yes!"

Fortunately, as Lara's curiosity and depression seemed to fade, Hans nodded eagerly.

“Because he is a man of great skill! He was also the one who trained me as much as I knew nothing.”

Such a great person recognized the talent of his sword. Lara seemed to be feeling a little better.

But it was also for a while.

'Then  what do you  do?'

The one she loved kept pushing her to change her weapon.

At first, it was only a gentle invitation, but as time went on, it became more and more coercive. And the attitude towards Lara also changed little by little.

Didn't you shake yourself off that you still have work to do?

'I can't do this.'

Feeling her expression darkening again, Hans gave up trying to appease her.

'Come to think of it, I didn't learn this from Zich-nim.'

As for how to deal with people, I only learned to scratch people's nerves subconsciously.

In the end, Hans decided to leave after accomplishing his purpose. It was clear that continuing the story would only make Lara feel worse.

“Have I not seen any suspicious people or incidents in this city?”

“•••A suspicious person or incident?”

"That's right."

"no. I haven't seen anything like that. What's going on?”

Hans thought it would be ok to talk about what he was doing.

'I'll be fine. The rumors were all circulating anyway, and there's no way this person, who is a colleague of Carwiman's Honorary Paladin, could be the culprit.'

But I had no intention of giving any details. Briefly summarized and explained.

“There are still kidnappings happening in the city, so we are investigating them.”

“A kidnapping case?”

Lara's eyes widened in surprise as if she didn't really know.

"That's right."

As Lara didn't seem to know, Hans couldn't find any more reason to talk to her. They weren't even close friends at first.

“Then I will go. We have to do more research to avoid harm.”

And Hans was about to turn back to proceed with the investigation.

"Wait!"

Lara called him up.

“If that’s the case, I’ll help too.”

“•••Are you Mr. Browning?”

Hans thought for a moment.

'I don't think there is any problem.'

Lara Browning's skills are quite good. Most of all, didn't Zich guarantee it? Besides, he is also a colleague of Gren Jennard, an honorary genitalia like Zich.

'And now there is a shortage of manpower.'

As they had to patrol the entire city, the more people there were, the better. However, manpower and budget are limited.

“First of all, even if you say you will help me with this work, I cannot give you anything in return.”

“I don’t want that. I just want to help people.”

Lara said, feeling a little offended that her good intentions seemed to have been distorted.

“If you say that, there is no reason for me to decline. But I did get some help, so I'll buy you a meal or a drink later."

“Are you flirting?”

“There is no room for that. I’m also busy with training.”

"i See."

Lara's expression softened somewhat, as she seemed to like Hans' focus on training.

"like. Then we'll work together with rice or a drink later."

"thank you. Then we go.”

So Hans began to investigate the city again, accompanied by one of his collaborators.

Unlike the date Hong-nae of Zich and Laila, Snock and Elena enjoyed walking around the city quite a bit. It wasn't that he didn't look like a lover on a date.

Zich, who was watching it from a distant roof, opened his mouth.

“Look at me. They also have to do what they love. That’s how you create such a natural atmosphere.”

“Yes.”

“So, my casino date was no problem at all.”

Lila didn't respond. No, I just ignored it. However, he didn't like Zich's bubbly face, so he spit out a word in the end.

"Once I tell you two gonna do it never hit my first day Tropez him run lines  out."

"what? It must have been a bit of a difficult date for you, right?”

If I kick it like this, will this guy fall off the roof? Lyla thought about it quite seriously.

However, while chatting like that, the two did not neglect Snock and Elena's surveillance.

The sun started to go down. The city's hires began to light the street lights one by one.

The sky turned yellow, and soon black darkness covered the sky.

“Take it easy, Zich. It’s time for things to happen.”

"I know."

Zich took Windur in his hand, and Lyla subtly enchanted his staff.

“Are you okay? I'm worried because Elena hasn't trained properly yet."

“Snock is pretty strong too. Did I train you? Don't worry, at least we'll be able to protect them until we get there."

The two narrowed the distance between Snock and Elena a little more than during the day.

* * *

“Oh, that was fun!”

Elena, who was walking along the street, stretched out her arms. In her arms were the items she bought today.

“Did we have fun too?”

coo!

Snock and Knowwet have a lot of work for the day.

seemed to enjoy it.

“Are you going to go back like this?”

“Let’s go around a few laps. It's time for a lot of things to happen. As a bait, we should take a little more time.”

“••• Come to think of it, it was.”

Elena raised the tension. Her body naturally stiffened.

Unlike Snock, who has followed Zich through all kinds of accidents, she joined the party not long ago.

Rather than having practical experience, he is now learning magic little by little. Of course, the speed was astonishingly fast, but it still needed the material of time.

Didn't she know that she was worried? Snock reassured her.

“Don’t be too nervous. Because Zich or Laila-sama around you will turn on your lights and watch if the culprit appears. If you two get caught, this is whoever the culprit is.”

Snock cut his throat terribly.

“And I can stop them until they come running. Right, right?”

coo!

“So, I think there will be a lot of situations like this in the future, so I will practice.”

“•••Isn’t it too practical for practice?”

“Give it up because that’s Zeek-sama’s style.”

As Snock smiled, Elena smiled as if she had given up. But that doesn't mean her tension has subsided.

Even Snock didn't think she would release the tension right away. So I looked around a little more carefully.

It was then.

Fight!

A shadow came out of the alley next door.

pooong

However, the shadow could not achieve its purpose as it hit the stone wall that sprouted right in front of it.

* * *

"come!"

Zich immediately kicked the roof. Lila jumped up and chanted a spell. The shadow blocked by Snok's wall pauses for a moment. But soon they broke the wall and tried to approach Snock and Elena.

But it was already after Zich approached the shadow.

“Look!”

With a lively chorus, Zich swings the Windur. The shadow hastily transformed itself to avoid Windur.

However, Zich's Windur was faster than Shadow's transformation. The tip of Windur passed the shadow.

Honey!

The shadow twisted as if in pain, then ran back into the alley.

Zich followed along. It was time for Zich, who had quickly caught up with the shadows, to wield Windur again.

I could feel the presence of something next to me.

'This!'

It feels quite powerful. Zich quickly broke Windur's trajectory and attacked the opponent.

Aww!

Windur and the opponent's sword collide. A loud bang was heard in the back alley. Zich frowned and looked at the sword facing Windur.

' Huh?'

The shape of the sword is familiar. A sword with a black blade.

'Tornium?'

Zich's beloved sword before returning. And now it is a sword that another being has.

Zich checked the opponent's face.

'Gren Jennard!'

An unexpected person appeared.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 283 screen

'Why is this bastard popping out of here?'

can't be happy He didn't even have a good impression in the first place, but Gren was one of the subjects that Zich was fervently suspicious of.

But Gren looked just as perplexed as Zich. His expression reflected that.

'Is this child related to the kidnapping case?'

I hope so. That way you can legally beat this guy down. And they will be able to spit out information by justly tortured.

'Still, it cannot be solved so easily.'

First, the shadows. It was when Zich turned to chase the shadow.

“Where!”

Whoo!

At the tornium flying towards him, Sieg hurriedly lifted Windur.

quaang

Once again a roar rang out. Zich glared at Gren sullenly.

“… Hey. What is this?”

“Where are you trying to run away from?”

" escape?"

Zich doesn't have the stupid idea that he should never run away before a fight. Rather, I tend to hate things like that, in order to protect one's pride, even if I had to take revenge later, I could only take revenge several times by increasing my strength later. The term strategic retreat is not for nothing. But that's something he would do only when Zich himself was at a disadvantage.

'It's not something to listen to to a child who hasn't matured yet.'

Even before his return, he was the one who managed to defeat himself by gathering all the geniuses called geniuses.

Zich glanced into the alley. The shadow was already gone. Even if you try to detect the presence, nothing is clearly detected.

Zich looked up. Lyla is floating in the air. I asked her if she had followed her by nodding, but she shook her head. And he pointed to Gren.

'Lyla's gaze was also on Gren.'

would have missed

Usually, even if one person gets in the way, the other person should not be discouraged from pursuing the goal. It's Lyla's mistake. But Zich understood.

'Lyra has little experience, so there's nothing I can do about it.'

In addition, Gren's interference was obviously the cause, but considering that he disappeared from Zich's presence within that short period of time, it must be said that the shadow itself has considerable skill in hiding.

'Ah, go crazy.'

one sigh I missed the clue to solve the case right in front of my eyes. Also because of a sudden interruption.

Zich looked at Gren. He is still staring at him with bloody eyes.

'Yeah, okay. If there is no good reason to disturb me, let me step on it.'

But he soon changed his mind.

'What is the appropriate reason. I was attacked in the first place.'

Zich fixed Windur.

'Let's just step on it. I got hit in the first place, so the reason is enough.'

Still, there are a lot of things that Gren Jennard has accumulated. Of course, they could all be Zich's misunderstandings.

'But what is that? It's the fault of the one who misunderstood me.'

"Huh? Then I saw that knife. Maybe you... !”

Gren seemed to be saying something, but Zich was already not listening to him. The answer was enough for what to do from now on.

Whoo!

Windur ran through space.

“What… !”

kuung

Tornium blocked Windur.

'Hmm, a knife against the tornium. I feel a little strange.'

But being immersed in such feelings is shorter than an instant. Blowing away unanswered emotions, Zich moved with honesty.

Only to step on Gren.

Chaeeng!

Zich gave the tornium a boost and bounced it off. Then he immediately laid the sword aside and swung it with his tongue.

“Wow!”

Gren hurriedly pulled himself out. Windur pursues. Gren hastily blocked it with a tornium.

quaang

Another crash.

'My skills are much better than when I saw you before.'

To receive heat is to receive it, and to look after others is to look at them.

'After all, it must be the guy who received the title of a hero.'

But it wasn't without problems.

'But why is this guy's magic power like this?'

The magic power contained in the sword is jagged. The guy's magic control is never immature. Before the return, as well as when we met briefly in the past, they were clearly quite stable.

'Where did you eat good food?'

So, it may be that he has not yet made that magic into his own. But anyway, that's Gren's case.

Quang! Quang!

Zich continued to swing his sword. Gren also struggled, but his sword began to become dull.

perok

“Big billion!”

Zich's feet pressed into Gren's stomach. Gren groaned. A face frowned in pain was visible.

'what?'

At that moment, Zeek felt a clear sense of elevation.

'Why are you in such a good mood?'

My heart that felt like a heavy stone had been placed on it until recently was completely released. It's like paving the muddy road down to your thighs with flagstones.

I see Gren clenching his teeth and swinging his sword again.

Chaeeng!

Zich uses Windur's branch-like sword god to weave the tornium and pull it to the side. Gren's arm came out as well, revealing his upper body brightly.

Zich clenched his fist. The target is Gren's face.

Whoops!

“Great!”

Gren's face turned back.

'Ahahahahahahahaha I'

Zich burst into laughter. If it wasn't for the bloody sword movement, I would have grabbed the boat and rolled over on the ground right away. The corners of his lips twitched uncontrollably.

'Hey, this is fun!'

Come to think of it, before returning, even before Gren's final blow, I wished I had beaten this face once, and I didn't grind my teeth.

That opportunity has come.

The memories of the shadows that Zich had already missed were gone.

He immediately punched his fist again. He tried to move the tornium, but it was still hung on the blade of Windur.

Whoops!

Gren's face turned. Blood spurted from the corners of his mouth.

'I have strong teeth.'

It was a pity that there was no one reflected through the blood.

'Well, if you haven't seen it, you can see it.'

It's as easy as smashing your face until the tooth breaks out. Zich tried to swing his fist again, but again, Gren wasn't the type to allow the same attack three times, if not twice. He succeeded in extracting the tornium.

quaang

The sword strikes once again. Gren's attack became more brutal than before. The bloody face is probably the cause.

But Zich didn't want to miss out on this delightful opportunity.

bang bang! bang!

The two swords continue to cross. Fisting and kicking also come and go.

But obviously there was only one person who had bruises and splashes of blood.

'O huh huh I'

Zich, who once again thrust his fist into Gren's abdomen, let out a small laugh. I really liked the feeling of being stuck firmly.

In my opinion, if not for eternity, it should be continued for at least one day.

But unfortunately that was not possible.

Due to the collision of powerful magic, the area around the alley had already been considerably damaged. The walls ripped open and the railings were cut. I felt people running away in all directions. That's how strong the two of them were.

However, this is a city, and it is also a place where the border has been raised due to a series of kidnappings. Naturally, the disturbance they caused was quickly known to the surrounding security forces.

“Stop!”

The soldiers enter the alley and point their spears at Zich and Gren.

Zich took the sword. Gren also took a few steps back when the attack was stopped. But his sword was still pointing at Zich.

Gren's mourning was a mess. Although he was not seriously injured, it was clear that he had been stabbed in several places by Zich. His handsome face looks swollen and bloody here and there. It was strange to know where the bones were hurt, and the steps were strange.

Seeing that, Zich was very remorseful. The feeling of the fist hitting that guy was still thrilling.

'Are you going to sleep without washing your hands today?'

It sounded like nonsense.

However, unlike the inside of Sieg, who maintains an extremely gentle and calm, the outside situation was serious.

“Explain the circumstances! No, I'll arrest you guys first! Drop your weapon right now!”

The soldiers pushed their spears one step further as Zich and Gren seemed to follow their words. Zich stood at them and tossed a tile.

"•••This!"

“Call me Zich, the honorary paladin of Carwiman, who is currently helping Count Dracul and the Mayor in tracking down this serial kidnapping case.”

The thing Zich threw was a kind of identification card given to those who cooperated with city security, passed down through Count Dracul.

“I was chasing the culprit, and I was interrupted by that author. So, the arrest should only be done by that person.”

Zich said, pointing to Gren, who was looking at him with a puzzled expression.

“… What do you say?”

Gren was muttering something. Sieg quietly just spoke again. At least for today, it seemed like he could be kind to Gren.

* * *

An intense fight took place in the city. A part of the back alley was damaged, but it was a miracle that it ended with only that much damage, considering the two people facing each other.

The leading forces investigating the current incident, including Joheim, and many soldiers gathered in the alley where the incident occurred.

The chief of the security force took turns listening to the ejaculation between Zeeke and Gren. The police chief who always showed a dignified appearance in front of the criminal chairs, but this time he did not assert his authority. No, I couldn't.

One was Carwiman's honorary paladin and acquaintance with the nobility, and the other was Carwiman's honorary paladin.

Zich explained to the security chief what he was doing. However, this Yue who attacked Gren mixed a bit of lies. He said that he thought he was a person who protected the criminal, not a personal grudge. He added that he had no choice but to attack because he thought he was a person who protected the criminal even though he knew him.

And Gren's excuse was similar. I was patrolling the back alley, and I saw a shadow like a famous serial kidnapper in the new city. While trying to pursue him, Zich suddenly appeared and saw him as a companion of the shadows. Of course, he knew after a while that he was not an enemy, but he also said that Sieg was already attacking him at that time.

Both of them are sure of their identity and have their own reasons. It's not that it's a little lax and it doesn't sound like an excuse, but he didn't have the courage to question the honorary paladin of Carwiman with that.

When Gren announced that he would pay for all the damage, he wanted to solve this case as good as possible.

“It seems like a clash due to a simple misunderstanding.”

The Marshal said to Zich.

“So, I think it would be best for the two of you to reconcile and move on.”

The Marshal looked at Zich.

“What does he say?”

“Oh, he says we can reconcile enough. Rather, he apologized for the misunderstanding. He also said that everything happened because of him.”

'That's what I meant.'

Considering Gren's external image, one might think that he humbly admits his mistakes and bears all costs. However, Sieg, who was already suspicious of Gren, thought that it was a play to give him a good image.

'Still, there is no harm to me.'

“It is not difficult. Let’s do that.”

The resentment that caused the shadow to disappear has already been sufficiently resolved.

'It's a bit sad though. I'm going to have to look for a few more.'

At least for the whole day or so.

But for now, I'm going to end this case here. It was time to come to terms with reality.

The chief of security gathered the two under the pretext of arranging reconciliation.

Zich and Gren face each other. Gren's new color had returned to its original state as if he had used a potion. However, there were still traces of disappointment in not being able to change clothes.

Seeing it made Zich's mood even better.

“There seems to have been a misunderstanding between us, so let’s solve it here.”

Zich held out his hand exhilaratingly. Gren held his hand.

“•••It is. Because I misunderstood and it was my fault for swinging the sword in the first place.”

“You know it well.”

Zich and Gren's handshake was brief. Soon the two parted. And he turned around without looking back.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 284 screen

Anyone who sees it seems that the sediments of the battle have just not been resolved. But it wasn't. The thoughts they had were much deeper than that.

Zich thought intently.

'I mean, Gurren Gennard is here.'

Did it just come by chance? The probability of that is also sufficient. But if it's been there for a purpose.

'It might help to uncover the identity of that guy.'

So you have to let him roam freely. And if you have it, you should use it.

It was another reason why Zich readily accepted reconciliation.

Zich went back to where his comrades were. Lyla, Snock, and Elena were waiting.

Gren was walking in the opposite direction to Zich. He turned his head for a moment and looked at Zich and the others. For a moment, his eyes were nailed to one.

It was a very brief moment. If it wasn't for the person who had been observing Glenn over and over, no, even the person who had been observing Glenn would not have noticed it unless he had a good sense or sensibility.

Gren turned his head as if there was no red rice.

However, his mind was very confused, unlike his appearance.

'Why Elena!'

The woman who should have been struggling in despair for herself by now was sitting next to Zich.

Did I see it wrong? I glanced at Zich's group once more. It was definitely her.

Although not actively mingling the story, there seemed to be no doubt that she was part of Zich's party.

'Damn it! Another variable!'

It was time for Gren to shout in his mind with all kinds of double swearing.

“Zek! What happened!”

I heard someone calling for Zich. a voice you know No, at least this time, it's a voice I'll never forget. Because it was the voice of Zich's colleague who was holding Estelaide. It was when Gren turned his head to confirm him.

'•••what!'

Gren had to desperately put up with the distorted impression once again.

Lara Browning was right next to the damn bastard who robbed Estelaide.

“Are you coming now?”

Zich said to Hans, who was running in a hurry.

“There was a lot of commotion from one side of the city and I ran to you, did you catch the culprit?”

"no. I met the culprit, but I missed it. Interference is coming.”

Zich glanced towards Gren. That's when they noticed Gren was staring intently at them.

'That bastard, why are you staring at me?'

The reason soon became clear.

“Gren!”

A woman following Hans's back called Gren and ran.

'Lara Browning.'

Gren's colleague. And before returning, he was the one who honestly blocked Zich's attack with his shield.

Zich asked Hans for an explanation with his eyes.

“I met him by chance while researching the city. They said they wanted to help with the investigation of the kidnappers, so I was with them.”

"okay?"

It's a strange relationship.

I saw Gren and Lara having a conversation. The two were smiling, but maybe it was because of their mood. The air flow between the two seemed awkward.

“We will go first.”

Gren lowered his head once and passed Zich and the others. Lara followed after him.

Lara lightly bowed her head to Zich and the others. And as she passed Hans, she said with a slight smile.

“I think I should receive treatment next time.”

“Anyway. It doesn't matter if the price is high.”

“I look forward to it. However, my taste is not that high-end, so there is no need to buy an expensive one. then."

After such a short conversation, Lara ran to Gren again.

“•••You look pretty friendly?”

Zich asked, putting his arm around Hans' neck. Laila was absurd, looking like a couple flirting with each other and arguing.

“The reason I got help was because I said that I would buy rice or a drink later. That’s all.”

“Hey, Hans doesn’t even know how to flirt with a girl anymore? It’s grown a lot.”

“I just wanted to pay for the help. Besides, it’s too hard to digest the training that Jeon Ji-kee gave me right now.”

“Well, that mindset is great.”

Zich ruffles Hans' hair.

“Still, give it a try. In the original way, they built friendships with one meal and one drink, and then love blossomed.”

“It seemed like someone liked it.”

“What does that matter? I got married by the way, and I have a child. person I like? You can change that target to you. Good! This is also education, and I will give you some useful advice... .”

"shut up! If you can't even date properly, you're going to give someone some advice!"

When Lyla was bruised, Zich protested.

“It's just that people just don't understand my date! Basically, what I do on a date is… !”

“Okay! If there is nothing more to do, go back!”

Lyla patted Zich on the back. Zich groaned and moved his feet.

“How did you meet that person?”

On the way home, Gren suddenly asked. Lara asked.

“That  person?”

“The person you went with.”

The damn bastard who stole Estelaide. To Gren now, Hans was more annoying than Zich. But that guy is Lara


were walking together

“We worked together because there were serial kidnappers roaming the city.”

Lara, who spoke calmly, did not feel any emotion. Perhaps it means literally.

"i See."

Gren passed on the question with an attitude that it meant nothing. But my heart was completely different.

'That guy... !'

The one who stole Estelaide. A person who has taken away the right that he deserves. That guy has now even approached Lara.

'Besides, there must have been Elena in their group!'

When I first saw that scene, it was no joke and my heart almost jumped out. I mean, why is she there?

If it hadn't been for years of experience, the mask I was wearing would have come off.

'I've never been a member of Ziek's party!'

But she certainly belonged to the Siegs.

'And even Joachim Dracul!'

variable. It was also a really terrible variable.

However, it wasn't the twisted variable that bothered him the most now.

'Estelaide was stolen, and Elena belongs to that group. And Leona was in that group too. In addition, Violuwin was even praising them as heroes!'

Fortunately, Leona was nowhere to be seen. In the end, did he fail to blend into that group and fall away? Or maybe it's just that we're not acting like we are right now.

But if you think about it, what does it mean? The truth is that he has been greatly deprived of his 'things' that he should have in the future.

'That's not enough, are you trying to steal Lara too!'

Lara 'preempted' herself first, but she doesn't know if she's taken what she owns to that extent.

'Anyway, there are no substitutes for Rubella in the castle!'

Elena and Leona also have to exchange for substitutes!

“By the way, Gren, where are you hurt? mogol

Why is this?”

Lara asked, glancing at Gren's messy attire.

“I got into an argument with Mr. Zich for a while. There was a misunderstanding between them.”

“With Mr. Zich?”

If it's Zich, it's definitely the person Hans used to serve.

Lara glanced at Gren again. The wound was not visible, but the sign of disappointment was evident. And I also remembered that there were no signs of fighting on the body of Zich I saw earlier.

“Did you get hit unilaterally?”

Gren's amazing growth is what she knows best. But to push Gren one-sidedly like that.

“That’s how it happened. After all, the world is wide.”

He changed his expression to a bitter smile. However, the inside was different from the outside.

'Bitch! Damn you Zich!'

If it wasn't for Lara next to me, I would have sharpened my teeth very thinly.

Contrary to the excuses he gave to the security chief, he clearly recognized Zeek and attacked him.

The reason was no different. It was to prevent Zich from chasing the shadow.

Of course, I thought that Zich might attack because of that.

But Gren was confident in his skills now. I didn't think that it would be this long as the opponent was the Zich.

But at least until the city's security forces arrived, I thought  I would be able to defend enough .

Although he has changed a lot from the Zich he knew, his skills must not have matured yet.

And since he received Carwiman's honorary paladin, he also thought that if the city's security forces intervened, he had no choice but to resign.

Gren's prediction was half right. Just as he thought, Zich withdrew when the city's security forces arrived. However, he completely misjudged Zich's ability.

'Even though there were variables, do you think there is a difference in skill to this extent at this point?'

Gren swung his sword desperately, but Zich had plenty of room for anyone to see.

The fact that he attacked Gren with only his fists and feet is proof of his leisure. Otherwise, the sword would have flew right away.

It doesn't matter if he tried to take Gren as a prisoner or if he just knew he had an acquaintance. For Gren, the difference in skill with Zich was important.

'I ate an elixir! Even if the magic control became a little difficult because of that, the magic power became strong enough to cover it up! Besides, it wasn't even his black Estellade! But I'm being pushed by the tornium!'

As Gren, unaware of the uniqueness of Windur, he misunderstood that his weapon's performance was overwhelming. But there wasn't even a fight.

A skill that far surpassed the Zich he knew at this time of year.

That misperception resulted in Gren himself being beaten in a mess.

In addition, when shaking hands as a sign of reconciliation, Zich's arrogant gaze was sent to him.

For a moment, Gren's eyes lit up with a deep murderous intent.

'Okay, let's move on now.'

If you think about it, there are countless times when you have been beaten by Zich. It's not like I'm used to that dirty feeling though. It's not like it's going to happen again.

'He said he was looking for a kidnapper in this city.'

It was the same with Gren.

Due to all kinds of variables, his plans were shattered and his fame did not go as far as expected. That's why I came here.

to kill the criminal.

'Anyway, his success rate isn't that high. Very few have survived to the Age of Demons. If that's the case, I'd rather kill him now and use it to increase my reputation.'

It's familiar. Besides, even if he survived to the Age of Demons, he wouldn't be the one who would be his sacrifice anyway. Just harvest a little earlier.

However, it is only surprising that Zich intervened here.

'I can't get my revenge on him right now.'

If your strength is not ripe and you are not ready, above all, it is not time.

'But it's okay to give him a light snack.'

I recall that haughty gaze again.

'I will kill this criminal!'

How would he feel when he was behind even while receiving support from the city? Gren laughed softly inwardly.

* * *

“Looks like you had a lot of fun? Were you having a lot of fun?”

“Hey, it was fun. It was a fantastic moment.”

Zich giggled and confirmed Lyla's words.

“I was trying to help, but I thought he was enjoying himself, so I left him alone. Are you fine?"

"Sure!"

With that judgment alone, Zich completely forgave Lyla for not chasing the shadows. Of course, I should say something, but that was just advice.

“I’m sorry though. I should have caught the culprit.”

Lyla was very sad because she also had her own situation.

“Well, there were interruptions, so I have to think that this time there is nothing I can do. It's a chance, I'll take it again."

And didn't a new possibility to identify the culprit appeared?

'Gren appeared in the city where there is a possibility that the robes are active. Of course we should investigate.'

Maybe I can catch him by the tail this time.

Zich quietly burned his enthusiasm.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 285 screen

After the clash with Gren, Zich's group continued to search for the culprit. However, the culprit did not go unnoticed by Zich and the others, as if he were protesting that that was the last mistake that could cause his tail to be stepped on. It was the same even if Snock and Elena were thrown as baits.

Apparently, the culprit wasn't even that stupid.

But the damage did not stop there. It seemed that the frequency had decreased, perhaps because of a sense of alertness, but the incidents continued steadily.

A few days passed like that, and Zich went somewhere early in the morning.

“Where are you going?”

Lyla asks in a slightly tired voice. She found Zich going out alone and followed her on a walk. Sieg didn't stop her, but he didn't say enough about the destination.

To Lyla's words, Zich only responded like this.

“To see an old friend.”

Is there a friend of Zich in this city? No, the fact that there is someone to call Zich a friend is a strange thing in itself.

'Does that character have a friend?'

It wouldn't be a bad thing for Lyla to think that way.

It was at a certain dorm where Zich stopped. It seems that the price is a little lower than the dormitory where Zich and his group are staying. However, if you look at the size of the building, the interior, the location, etc., it was a luxury accommodation that could not be ignored.

'A rich friend?' I thought he was like a vaguely fussy bastard to be called Zich's friend, but he seems to be a friend with a lot of fortune.

'Or is it a rich bastard?'

It was when Lyla was imagining a person who persecuted people by sprinkling gold and giggled.

“Hey, I don’t even need to ask you to call me.”

Zich was happy to see someone coming out of the front door of the dormitory.

The person coming out now seems to be Zich's friend. Lyla, curiously, took a closer look at the man who was said to be Zich's friend.

“… uh?"

Unbeknownst to Laila's mouth, a questionable voice burst out. The person that Zich called a friend was someone that even Lyla knew. So it was more unexpected. That person never seemed to be friends with Zich.

"uh?"

The other person's heart is similar to that of Lyla. His eyes widened as he left the dormitory, nailed to Zich. As if his body had hardened, he stood still, blocking the entrance.

“What, why all of a sudden? You cannot stand with the door closed.”

When the entrance was suddenly blocked, Lara, a woman who was about to follow him, stood in front of the door and pushed him forward. Gren, who was frozen in front of the door, stepped forward. But his gaze was still nailed to Zich.

“Why the… !”

Lara found Zich, who was about to complain to Gren. She was surprised too.

"what? Obviously the last time... .”

"Yes, that's right. Have you introduced yourself before? If you don't remember, I'll do it again."

“Oh, no. I remember. Did you say Mr. Zich?”

"Yes. You said you were Lara Browning, didn't you? I heard from Hans.”

"Yes that's right."

Although they were talking, Lara was embarrassed. It was quite difficult to deal with Zich, unlike Hans, who had talked to him a few times.

When we first met, it wasn't a very good meeting, and the last time we had a fight with Gren. Ren said it was his responsibility, but regardless of the reason, how can he get a good look at his fans by beating the man he likes?

However, it was because of Zich's expression that she began to stutter.

So bright and friendly There have been troubles since the first meeting, and I can't think of the attitude of dealing with the opponent and the party who have been in a really open battle recently.

It literally felt like meeting an old friend.

Lyla looked at Zich with a suspicious look.

'•••Aren't these people supposed to be friends?'

Zich doesn't get along very well with Gren and Lara, especially Gren. Lyla thought there was some misunderstanding or a chance meeting before meeting Zich's friend.

However, contrary to Lyla's perception, Zich approached Gren with light steps.

"how are you?"

"Ah yes."

Gren was also confused, so he couldn't speak properly. But Zich didn't care.

“Hey, I’m glad you look okay. No matter how much I misunderstood, I felt guilty for not doing it too much last time.”

It's a strangely irritating tone. Lara's face was slightly displeased. But Gren only smiled bitterly, and he wasn't too offended. Of course, that was just an appearance.

"Fine. It's been a pretty good lesson for me too. But what are you up to here? Do you have anything to do with this inn?”

"Yes. To be precise, you have something to do.”

“For me?”

Maybe the last fight brought something up? But looking at Zich's attitude and his current words and actions, it doesn't seem like that.

"That's right. Aren't you also chasing the culprit in a serial kidnapping case?"

"Yes."

“Did you find any clues?”

“… Why are you asking such a thing?”

Gren asks suspiciously. Zich answered with a still friendly look.

“I was trying to ask you to cooperate.”

“Cooperation?”

Gren, of course, was surprised by Lara and Lila. In particular, that of Laila was more of a surprise than a surprise. Maybe it's because Zich couldn't catch the culprit recently, or because of some kind of stress, he went crazy. He even doubted whether the man in front of him was really Zich.

As Lyla knows, Gren Jennard is the person Zich hates the most and is hesitant to do right now. But, he himself asks Gren for help.

“•••It is sudden. It’s embarrassing, too.”

“Of course it will. We're not even on good terms. Strictly speaking, it’s closer to the gritty side.”

Gren didn't answer, but anyone could tell that it meant affirmation.

“But who are we? Isn't that Carwiman's honorary paladin? Those who have been chosen by Rowoon Carwiman. That means we are just people.”

Lyla's face turned pale. He began to seriously ponder whether or not he should return to normal by hitting the back of the head of Zich, who seemed to have gone insane.

Jack's words continued.

“Although we have different personalities and opinions, I think that at least the idea that there should be no more innocent victims is the same. So, wouldn't it be right to put aside the grudges of the past for a while, put off the incongruent tendencies for a while, and then cooperate and catch the culprit right now?”

No wonder he was moved, and everyone who heard that Zich himself thought so was terrified.

But Zich's words weren't wrong either.

Gren responded with a little hesitation, and Zich spoke again.

“What are you hesitating about? Shouldn't we immediately join hands with the righteous Carwiman's honorary paladin? Or is there some other way?”

“There is no such thing, but… .”

“Then there will be no hesitation.” Zich walked over to Gren and patted his shoulder. If you look at it, it looks like you're dealing with a friend you've known for about 20 years. Gren pulled his neck aside. Anyone can see that he is embarrassed by Zich. However, he couldn't push Zich away.

“••• Cooperation, what exactly are you talking about?”

“As I said before, I have an acquaintance with the person in charge of this case. He is supported by the Lord and the Mayor. I would like to have you there for the exchange of information and meetings every evening on this case.”

“•••The name of him is . . . .”

“You must have seen me once before. A young man with me, wearing luxurious armor. He is Count Dracul.”

“Who is the Count?”

Gren pretended to be surprised. But inside, he rolled the calculations in a complicated way.

"Yes. Of course, we will support you as well. Wouldn't it be better to exchange information and cooperate with each other than to chase alone?"

Gren seemed to ponder for a moment. But soon he opened his mouth.

“•••Mr. Zich certainly makes sense.”

"Yes! I am not a nonsense person!”

Lila, who unconsciously wanted to completely deny Zich's words, was fortunate to be able to prevent the catastrophe that came out of her mouth through extreme perseverance.

"great. Whatever happened to each other, we must first stop the damage from spreading. We will cooperate.”

“Well thought out, Mr. Jennard.”

The two shook hands. look at each other and smile At first glance, it seems that they are sharing trust with each other.

But only they themselves would know what the two of them were inside.

* * *

“What are you up to?”

On the way back home after confirming cooperation with Gren, Lyla grabbed Zich's arm and asked.

"what?"

“The conversation I just had with Gren Gennard.”

“Oh, you mean the conversation I had with my old friend?”

"friend? friend? Are you  not enemies ?”

“Why are you living so tight? No matter how much I hate a dog like a dog, if I can use it and eat it, how can I be a friend? I can treat you like a benefactor like heaven.”

Jack giggled.

Lila shook her head. Zich's actions were astonishing. And at the same time, it was terrifying. Because Zich's appearance was that of a person who would do anything to achieve an end.

"great. I knew you were going to eat with Gren Jennerd. Then what is the use value?”

Jack's expression changed. They have the same smile. But the quality of that laughter was different. It had just been a lively laugh like a mischievous one, but now it is a sharp, cold, ruthless laugh.

Even Lyla, who had become accustomed to Zich, got goosebumps for a moment.

“I now suspect that this guy is the black screen that makes demons and a hypocrite covered in the skin of a good man. do you know The present plan is built on that hypothesis.”

Zich spoke sullenly, like a conspiring villain.

“You create a demon and kill it yourself to increase your reputation. If that's his behavior, the reason we're looking for the culprit this time is for that behavior. No, it's funny to say that you're looking for it. There's no way he doesn't know the culprit."

“Then why don’t you deal with the culprit right away?”

“I guess we are aiming for a more dramatic time. The more damage accumulates and the more fearful the city gets, the higher his name will rise when he solves it.”

"then… .”

It's a really dirty story, so Leila clicked her tongue.

“So I took it in. If he really knows the culprit, he's trying to dig up that information."

“What if I refused?”

“So I drove it. spit out those words that have absolutely nothing to do with justice or anything.” Leila remembered the words of Zich, which made her goosebumps as she listened.

"I don't know if he's really a good guy or a hypocrite, but once he's covered in the skins of a good guy, I can't refuse to cooperate to reduce damage."

It was then that Laila could fully understand Zich's behavior.

“Heh heh! Based on his information, if I hit and kill the criminal first, how much will he disassemble!”

The gloomy energy emanating from Zich, who shed a low laughter, took a step away from Lila. After all, if Zich was turned into an enemy, it was clear that he was a very troublesome person.

But Zich's words are certainly true.

“Yes. Okay, I'll help too."

“Okay, then, let’s get Gren Gennard’s information out of the way.”

So, the two went back to the dorm, talking about the future.

and after some time.

“He is the one who will help us in the future.”

“This is Gren Jennard. It's a small force, but I'll do my best to help."

Gren Jennard began to attend the meeting.

# No. 286 screen

The only people in the meeting who knew Gren were Zich and Lyla. Joachim and Evelynn are meeting Gren for the first time.

Joachim stood up and held out his hand to Gren.

“Nice to meet you. Count Joachim Dracul. I saw you once a while ago.”

Contrary to his treatment of Zich, Jo Haim was antipathetic to Gren. But it was natural.

This world is truly a place where the class system lives and breathes. The reason Joachim uses the highest name for Sieg is because Siek is a great benefactor to him.

Originally, commoners didn't even need a rebel, but Gren was no ordinary commoner.

“I heard that he is an honorary paladin of Carwiman, just like Zich-sama. We look forward to your help in the future.”

“I hope the Count will teach you in many ways.” Gren's attitude was very polite. Show respect for the other person's status by lowering yourself, but don't look submissive because it's not overdone.

Joachim lightly admired Gren's attitude.

“It’s Evelyn Rouge. It’s a lack of strength, but we’re collaborating with other people.”

“This is Gren Jennard. nice to see you."

“For reference, the young girl of Rouge is the young girl of the Marquis of Rouge in the neighboring country.”

"Is that so?"

Gren's eyes widened as if surprised by Joheim's explanation. It was as if he had discovered Evelynn's identity for the first time.

Zich looked at him without any strange emotions.

'To see the three of them shaking hands like that.'

Before returning, Zich, Yoheim, and Evelynn fought to kill each other as the Demon King and his subordinates, and Gren as the Hero. And in the end, Joachim, Evelynn, and Zich also lost their lives at the hands of Gren.

But now they are holding hands to cooperate.

Of course, Zeeke himself looks at Gren suspiciously, and Gren sharpens his sword inwardly, like Zich's suspicions.

However, this did not diminish the uniqueness of the present scene.

When the greetings were over, the people sat down at each other's seats.

“First, we give Mr. Jennard the information we know.”

Zich handed him some papers. There was written the date of the incident, the location of the incident, information about the victims, and any clues they found to the culprit.

However, the information on the clues of the criminal was very poor compared to other information.

Gren carefully checked the information.

“Not much information has been revealed.”

“It’s embarrassing.”

Joachim was stunned.

“No, there is no need to be ashamed. To be honest, didn't my opportunity to catch the culprit was thwarted by my obstruction? To be shy, I have to do it.”

In Gren's voice, the feelings of regret and guilt were evident.

'There has been nothing strange so far.'

Gren was very good-natured, much more suited to the appearance of the Carwiman Honorary Paladin than Zich.

As if claiming Zich's suspicion was wrong. However, Zich was not impressed with the sight.

'If it's a hypocrite, he's deceived the whole world, but he wouldn't reveal his true face with just such a thing.'

On the contrary, it is more suspicious if you feel bad and run wild here.

Gren also provided information he knew. The information he gave out was worse than what Zich and the others had.

But no one cursed Gren with it.

With the support of the city, Zee and Gren, who move as a group, have no choice but to lose money in obtaining information. Besides, I heard that Gren had just come to this city.

But Carwiman's history as an honorary paladin will definitely help. That is why others did not oppose Gren's joining.

The meeting proceeded in earnest. On a large table, they open up a map of the city where the incident took place and exchange their thoughts.

“The location of the incident is like a back alley or nearby, but there is no uniformity in the region.”

Gren said, looking at the places where the incident occurred one by one.

"Yes. I use the whole city as if it were my home. He's a diligent, matchless guy. To no avail.”

Jack replied.

So a few more words came and went.

“Mr. Jennard, what kind of person do you think this culprit is?”

Jack asked.

“I can’t say for sure as there is not much information gathered yet… .”

"I know. I just want to hear Mr. Jennard’s opinion.”

As if not to be burdened, Zich's tone was calm. But that's just the appearance. Zich lifted his ears to listen carefully to Gren.

“Then some.” Gren coughed a few times before opening his mouth.

“First of all, you must be someone who knows the city very well. Especially the back alleys.”

Gren tapped the marked spot.

“The incident took place at the back alley or the entrance to the back alley. Perhaps to move the kidnapped person out of sight. Maybe it's to use the complicated back alley as an escape route. If you look at the criminals from the past and look like a shadowy criminal, it is not strange even if you have special abilities.”

People nodded. That was what they had guessed.

“And in the back alleys, there is a high probability that he will be a significant tycoon or influential person. The scene of the incident is the entire city. No matter how familiar you are with backstreets, there is probably no one who is familiar enough to cause an incident in the backstreets of the entire city. It’s hard if it’s a personal crime.”

“Do you think this case is a group case?”

“Even if it is not a group, I think that at least I am a person who can use the power of the group. Otherwise, I think it would be difficult to understand the alleys of the city as a whole. The back alleys of the city are not well understood even in the city, right?”

Gren nodded when he asked Joachim.

"exactly. Then, even if it is a group, a place like a criminal organization that has a lot to do with back alleys is likely.”

"I agree."

Gren nodded.

“And you have to look at the time when the incident happened. Usually events occur after sunset until late at night. He must be someone without an alibi at this time.”

“If it was a group, it would be useless, but… .”

“It’s just as Zic said. But I don't know if it's an individual who leads a group or is associated with a group."

“So is it.”

“And I think that maybe he is someone who has lost his lover.”

“Is it because of the characteristic of only targeting lovers?”

"Yes. It is very strange that only one of the lovers is kidnapped to think that it is for a purpose. I don't know if it's because of my short experience, but purposeful kidnapping usually targets beings like children or a specific gender, such as male or female, and kidnapped one of the lovers unconditionally? It would be better to think of it as the psychology of the criminal rather than a special purpose.”

“So, do you think that the man who lost his lover is doing this out of jealousy?”

“I don't know if jealousy is the cause of the kidnapping. However, I think there is a high possibility that jealousy towards the lover was involved in the selection of the kidnapping target.”

"i See."

Zich thought for a moment and smiled.

“It was an interesting comment. There are quite a few aspects that are similar to the thoughts we shared.”

“It’s a thought that everyone should do at least once.”

“Still, it was very helpful. The more people with the same opinion, the more persuasive the opinion is. Anyway, I got a lot of help today. I wish you all the best in the future.”

“Me too, Mr. Zich.”

Zich and Gren shake hands. Ren said goodbye to the others and left the room.

“That’s what Jennard thinks.”

“It’s not that different from us.”

Joachim and Evelynn have a conversation. Gren's opinion had already been shared with them to some extent.

“But it was quite interesting to say that it was a group event. I thought he was an individual with special abilities because of his shadowy appearance.”

“First, let’s try to find the culprit by focusing on the overlapping opinions. I think that’s the best way to go about looking into people blindly.”

“I agree with Mr. Zich. How about Young-ae Rouge?”

“I have no objections.”

They agreed to submit comments about the culprits to the city for investigation into those involved.

So the meeting ended.

Joachim and Evelynn returned. However, Lyla still remained by Zich's side.

"what's the matter?"

Zich, who was sipping a glass of beer he had asked for at the dormitory, and calmed down the tiring day of the day, asked Lyla.

“Did you get any good comments from Gren Jennard?”

“To some extent.”

"uh? really?"

Lyla was surprised. It must have been either she or Zich who listened to Gren, but she didn't get any meaningful information from Gren.

“What kind of copy is it?”

“You heard it too. what the guy said. A person who knows the backstreets of the city well, is a group or heads a group, and has lost a lover there.”

It was definitely information that Laila had heard. But Lyla frowned rather than rejoicing that she had an answer.

“Is that information?”

"then. Very good information.”

“It’s all about reciting information that everyone knows. Most of it was already information we were guessing.”

"right. But that's it, Lyla. It also matters whose mouth comes from.”

Zich spins the beer mug. The beer slowly rotated in the glass. I enjoyed it and drank it.

“Kyaa ~ !”

He let out a sigh and put down the glass roughly.

“What kind of guy is Gurren Jennard in your memory?”

Lyla was a little perplexed by the sudden question.

“Oh, well? A hero who wielded a holy sword and fought against the mighty demon king and demons to protect people?”

“Oh, I get goosebumps just listening to it.”

Zich scratched his forearm.

“Anyway, he was famous for killing demon kings and demons during the Demon Age, but he was also highly evaluated for his ability to judge the situation and reason. In particular, he recognized his analytical ability and intuition to find hidden demons with even the smallest clues. Now that he's suspicious, it just feels like a show."

“Then what Gren Jennard said earlier…”

“It is very likely to be true.”

Zich took one of the snacks and spit it out calmly. But Lyla couldn't be as calm as Zeeke.

If he is right, they have now obtained considerable information about the culprit.

“Come on, wait! Still, there is a possibility of mixing lies with it!”

"Sure. But still, I wouldn't mix it much. If he lied, he misjudged the information about the culprit, and in that case, his image of excellent situational judgment, analysis ability, and intuition would be halved.”

“•••Do you think Gren Gennard is calculating and moving to such an image?”

“Uh”
huh •

Lyla was at a loss for words. I even thought that I might have gone too far.

But Zich was adamant.

“If my suspicions are correct, he is a madman who creates magic for his image as a hero, and hits goals that even I can’t reach. A guy like that would be able to do that kind of behavior.”

"•••So you're saying that most of the information Gren Gennard said is true?"

"okay. And personally, I doubt that all of Gren Gennard's information this time is true.”

“Then it doesn't serve Gren Gennard's purpose. Wouldn't it be bad for him if we find the culprit first?"

"Sure. So, the culprit probably fits everything he said about the culprit, but there must be something difficult to specify.”

Zich said, looking down coldly at the empty beer glass.

“You have to find it.”

(Continued on next page)


# No. 287 screen

The opinions of Sieg's party were conveyed to the upper part of the city by Joheim. The superior, who thought it was reasonable, began to search the city to find the suspect.

As the lord watched with interest, the mayor was involved, and even the lord of the neighboring estate cooperated, the officials moved quickly.

Shortly thereafter, a basic suspect was identified. Because of the point that it was a huge group that could cover the entire back alley, the suspects had to be limited.

“I was able to screen out a few of them.”

Joachim handed him some papers. A total of three suspects were written there. They were all people who raised their voices in the world behind them.

“These are the guys that best fit our thoughts. It would be nice to get something out of these guys.”

“That’s it.” However, Zich was not interested in flipping through the documents.

'For now, these guys are not.'

If it is a guy that can be easily identified with the information Gren gave, it should be considered not. Rather, Sieg was more interested in the other documents Joheim brought than the documents he was holding.

''  What are those  documents?"

“They are also suspects. But they are the ones we put off for a while because some dogs didn't meet certain conditions.”

Zich's eyes lit up. This is exactly what Zich was looking for.

“Can I see you?”

“Anyway.”

As Joheim handed the papers, Zich slowly turned them over.

As Johaim said, they are far from the impression they had of them. Someone who is not involved in the afterlife, does not belong to a group, has never lost a lover, etc.

After skimming through the papers, Zich patted the paper on the desk to match the shape.

“Can I borrow these for a while? Given the number of the most likely suspects right now, I don't think it's necessary to mobilize all of us. Me and Lila will look at these people.”

“If you think about it, it is. All right. If you learn anything, please let me know right away.”

With Joheim's permission, Zich took Lyla out. Lyla pulled her neck over Zich's shoulder and looked at the profile he was holding.

“Do you think the culprit is there?”

“It’s a lot more likely than those who are called top suspects.”

“If Gren Jennard was a real hypocrite, wouldn’t it be possible that he had something more twisted?”

“I wouldn’t have hidden the culprit so closely. There is no need to keep hiding the identity of the perpetrator, and we only need to buy enough time to amplify the fear in the city anyway.”

Zich returned to his dormitory and gathered Hans, Snock and Elena together.

“I am going to meet people who may be the culprits in the future. When you meet these people, if you notice something strange, don't hesitate to let them know, even in the smallest detail.”

The more people there are, the better. The three people nodded their heads seriously at Zich's sincere words.

Thus, Zich's search for the suspect began. Apparently, the condition of 'relating to the back alley' was attached to the selection of the suspect, so the people they met were rough people. Therefore, when Zich and his party visited, they often tried to intimidate him by creating an uneasy atmosphere.

However, the identity cards given by Joheim and Zich's force were enough to make them docile and obedient.

So Zich and his group went around looking for the people who were listed on the documents. However, there has been no clear evidence of doubt.

After exploring like that, the sun was setting slowly.

'I have to go back.'

There was a meeting today. We must leave now so we will be on time for the meeting.

“Let’s go back.”

Zich led the group and started walking toward the dormitory. When he returned, he widened his sense of humor to monitor any possible incident. So did Hans and Snock. Upon receiving Zich's command, Hans also extended his senses to the maximum, and Snock sensed the vibrations of the earth.

However, there were no clear results.

'Aren't you going to find the robes too?'

Obviously, Joheim said that there were eyewitness accounts of the robes. However, Zich has so far searched the city and has not seen any traces of the robes.

It may not have been found. The information may be incorrect. But it could have been another case.

'If they have finished their mission.'

As they are the people who make mines, there is a chance that they will let go of their hands if the mines are complete.

'Then things get complicated.'

Zich's power became very strong. However, if it is possible to simply kill all the demons, that is not the case.

'Because there is a class in Mine.'

They may be strong, or they may have very unusual special abilities.

'I'm going to have to be prepared for a little headache.'

However, it cannot be confirmed that Mine is complete.

'Now this kidnapping case may be in the process of gaining his own power.'

Anyway, if the culprit is a new mine made by the robes, the sooner they find it, the better.

'Still, today's investigation is over.'

It's not as good as going slowly if you're impatient and rushed to work. Zich raised his hand and stretched it as he walked under the indigo blue sky.

next day. Zich's group continued their investigation. After walking through the streets and meeting a few people, they lined up in front of a building.

"you… .”

Lyla narrows her eyes and looks at Zich. It deserved it. Because they lined up at the casino where Zich had a date and brought Lyla.

Zich shrugged and explained.

“Don’t look at it that way. No matter how rubbish I am, I can't go to gamble between these incidents... .”

Zich was speechless.

“••• Come to think of it, I am such a scum, right? I have a lot of time, would you like to go out for one round?”

Not only Lyla, but also Hans, Snock, and Elena stare at Zich indifferently.

coo... .

Even Nowm helped.

"I'm kidding."

Zich grinned and patted Lyla on the shoulder.

“Let’s go in. You're busy at one o'clock."

“Anyway, you.”

Lila couldn't help but sigh.

“Who are you going to meet here?”

Hans asked.

“I am the owner of this casino.”

Zich took out a piece of paper from his bosom and wrote the profile of the person he was about to meet.

“My name is Kendell Isid. in the back alley

It is said that he was a person with a position in the ground who built this casino while doing private debt business.”

“Then there must be some relationship in the back alley?”

said Lyla.

"right. He said that he was a detailed character in the back alley and had a lot of power. In every way, he's the perfect person for us to suspect."

“Then why are you out of the final suspect?”

“With or without a lover.”

“You don’t have a lover?”

“No. Not recently, but from a long time ago. According to the people around him, he is very stingy and cruel, so even if he has a lover, he is a human being who will sell him for money.”

Other people's expressions got worse. It's not the kind of person that people with normal emotions would like. Of course, by Zich's standards, he was a decent human being who couldn't even be included in the axis of evil.

“That’s why I fell out of the top suspect. But do you know? He must have been a romantic guy who was secretly dating and would risk his life for that lover.”

Saying that, Zich opened the casino door.

Inside, there were still many people engaged in gambling. A typical gambling hall with sighs and profanity resounding from all sides and occasional cheers.

However, unlike his usual swearing and cheering, he did not even pay attention to the gambling board.

"Hey!"

Zich called the bodyguard who was on the wall of the casino and was watching to see if there were any riots.

“What are you doing?”

“I’m going to have to meet the owner of this casino.”

The bodyguard's eyes frowned. Sometimes there are people like this. A person who wants to meet the owner of a crappy casino. And most of those people were not good customers, such as those who had bad feelings about losing money in the casino, or who somehow tried to make money with the casino owner.

The bodyguard spread his shoulders as if inflated. He made a rough impression and stood intimidating them. In most cases, this pressure alone will solve the problem.

“I’m sorry, but the boss is not someone I can meet casually.” The tone is polite, but the voice is low. The person passing by was trembling and widening the distance.

But Zich didn't blink an eye.

“It is not up to you to decide.”

A tile was pushed in front of the bodyguard, who was contemplating whether to use his hand on Zich's words.

“I have business to deal with because of the serial kidnapping case currently taking place in the city, so please guide me carefully. If your boss suffers a disadvantage because I can't meet your boss, can you take responsibility?' The bodyguard's momentum waned when he saw the hand. The tile with the clear seal of the city mayor was not a tile that such a jolta could dare to do.

"•••Please wait a moment."

As if the momentum had just gone, the bodyguard spoke politely and went up the stairs at a quick pace. It was the place where the VIP or  VVIP of the casino gambled. And upstairs will be the casino owner's room.

The party waited for the bodyguard to arrive. Lyla glanced at Zich, who always sang a gamble gamble song whenever she came near here. But now, Zich showed no interest in gambling.

'I also do it when I do it.'

Usually, he looks like a gambler who is addicted to gambling, but Siek is also a big guy.

'Well, it's even called the future demon king, but there's no way you can't get your mind off the gambling board.'

As Lyla thought so, the bodyguard rushed down the stairs.

“The boss wants to see you. I

Follow me.”

The group slowly climbed up the stairs embroidered with red carpets under the guidance of the bodyguard. After passing the VIP space on the second floor, the VVIP space on the third floor came out.

When they entered the third floor, Hans, Snock, and Elena let out a low elasticity. The first floor of the casino was definitely luxurious, but it was nothing compared to the third floor of this place . It was a decoration comparable to that of any high-ranking nobleman's mansion.

But that was not the destination either. They crossed the table stacked with chips that were incomparable to the gambling board on the first floor, and they went up one more floor.

As we reached the 4th floor, the atmosphere changed. The splendor of the gambling board completely disappeared, and a serious interior welcomed them.

There was a door right at the end of the stairs. The guard knocked on the door.

"boss! We have guests!”

“Take it!”

A voice came from beyond the room. The bodyguard opened the door. Then, looking at Zich's group, he turned his arms inward.

“Come in.” As Zich's party entered the room, the security guard quietly closed the door from the outside.

Zich looked around the room first. The interior was not very different from the appearance of the fourth floor outside the door . Overall, it has a serious atmosphere.

There was very little furniture. It was concise at best, and bleak at worst. The space was very spacious, and it had that kind of atmosphere.

Zich looked straight ahead. A large desk with a nice interior was in the center of the space, and someone was sitting there.

“•••Are you from the city because of the kidnapping?”

"That's right. It's called Jack. Those behind me are my company.”

The opponent slowly raises his body.

Zich looked at his opponent.

Her hair is all white, and her eyebrows are thin. up to three hundred. The long, vertical scar on the left eye side is an added bonus.

A person with an atmosphere like the boss of a back alley gang slowly approached Sieg. he held out his hand

"nice to meet you. The owner of this casino is Kendel Isid.”

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Isid.”

Zich took Kendell's extended hand and waved it a few times.

“Yes, Mr. Zich. What do you want me to do?”

“It’s not a big deal, because I want to ask you a few questions about the kidnapping.”

“I don’t know what you want to ask, but since you came from the city, I will do my best to cooperate.”

But speaking with that terrifying face, it seems rather sarcastic and intimidating. Elena, who had little experience yet, swallowed her saliva.

But Zich calmly asked a question.

“I know you still have a lot to do with the afterlife.”

Was it a sensitive question? Kendell looked at Zich with his distinctive three-hundred eyes. Zich didn't even look away.

Soon, Kendell opened his mouth heavily.

"Yes."

“Are you easy to admit?”

“It doesn’t even fit on the secret axis. Moreover, I know that the city is taking this kidnapping case very seriously. I can't tell lies."

And Kendell laughed. No, he looked like he was smiling.

It looked like it could kill at least a few children just by looking at it if it had only smiled twice, with its mouth slightly open and its fangs glistening.

“It’s a good decision. Then the question continues.”

Zich checked one by one to see if the profile he saw was correct.

'There is nothing wrong with your profile.'

Zich put the profile items in his head back into his mind.

“Then may I ask where you were at the time of the incident?”

Kendell's eyes turned to Zich and then to Zich's group behind him. Then he turned around and looked at Zich again.

“•••A bit late question, but can it be said that I am being suspected of being the culprit?”

“Don't worry. Ishid is not the prime suspect.”

“I don’t think it’s something to say not to worry about.”

But Kendell's attitude was calm. A majesty like the boss of a giant organization in the back world spewed forth.

“Yes, what is the date and time?”

Zich told us the date and time of the incident.

“I was alone at home. It’s bad for me.”

“It is fortunate for Mr. Leeseid and unfortunate for us, but there are many people who do not have an alibi at that time. You don't have to worry that much.”

"Is that so? Contrary to what it was before, it is correct to say that it is less worrying now.”

“Then the last question, Mr. Ysid. Have you or have you been in a relationship with someone? It doesn’t matter whoever went to the marital relationship.”

" There is not."

Kendell's words were even loaded with decisiveness.

“Is there anyone who has had room to develop into a romantic relationship?”

"There is not. Even if you do all the research around me, you will get the same answer. Because all I want is money, not useless lover games.”

Kendell gave that bloody laugh once more.

“Can I accept that there was no one I loved at all?”

“I think it’s okay to accept it that way.”

A firm answer. The eyes that do not feel a word of affection are impressive.

Jack nodded his head.

I asked everything I could ask.

“Thanks for your cooperation, Mr. Isid.”

“Then please catch the culprit as soon as possible. Our casino is also being damaged because of that incident.”

“I do my best.”

After saying goodbye, Zich and his group left the room.

The bodyguard, who was waiting at the door, who had guided Zieke and his party to the room earlier, led them out of the casino this time.

“Take a look.”

I politely said hello and the bodyguard closed the door.

Contrary to the seeming behavior, perhaps he is hoping that Zich and the others will never come again. Probably definitely.

Lyla asked Zich.

“Has there been a harvest?”

"no."

"okay. Then I'll have to find the next person."

I'm already accustomed to going out of trouble. Lila turned her attention to the next person.

Zich also took out a piece of paper with a different profile on it. Then I looked back.

You can see the splendid and grandiose casino.

'For now, I have to go back.'

But it wasn't suspicious. If anything happens later, I'm ready to bite you right away. But without evidence, there is no culprit.

'If it was the same before the return, I would have tortured them one by one to find them.'

It doesn't matter if you can't find it. If all the suspects are killed, there is a high probability that the culprit is there.

But right now, it is impossible because I am not walking the path of the Demon King.

Zich took the party and left the front of the casino.

Kendell looked through the spear as Zich and the others moved away.

When they disappeared, they turned around. As if it were empty, he crosses one room and approaches the desk.

Druck!

opened the drawer. There was a small frame upside down. Kendell carefully pulled out the frame.

The frame had a portrait of a woman painted on it. The appearance of a pretty woman who smiles softly.

"•••Laura."

Kendell swept down the frame lovingly. At least now, I couldn't find the cold side I had shown to Zich until recently.

As if he had forgotten the passing time, he swept down the frame for a while.

how much has it been He took his eyes off the frame. His eyes, which had been dripping with loveliness until recently, returned to their usual cold-heartedness in an instant.

'•••I was told that I was freed from the main suspect, but I hope he will come to see me so soon.'

Kendell thought of Zich.

'By the way, the lord next door said that there was a separate team. That's what that guy is.'

Not good. It does not seem to be at the stage of serious suspicion yet, but there may be circumstances.

'I'll have to go ahead with the plan a little bit faster from now on. and… .'

Kendell's eyes fell sullenly.

'Should I give a small gift to those who work hard?'

♦ * *

A few days after meeting Kendell Isid at the casino, Zich stumbled upon Yoheim while on the road to investigate.

“Are there any results?”

At Zich's question, Johaim shook his head.

"There is not. To be precise, there is no result in the kidnapping case.”

“Then what other results were there?”

“I came to know this while investigating the kidnapping case, and it was revealed that one of the top suspects had committed a crime. He killed and buried his cheating lover.”

It was discovered by chance while digging into the suspects' dead lovers.

It was a significant case and achievement, but the culprit of the abduction of Nao-ran was not revealed and Yo-haim could not hide his disappointment when the murder and burial cases were revealed.

“First of all, he must not be the culprit in the kidnapping case. There will be no envy or jealousy towards a good lover. No, do you want to burn even more time?”

“For now, we are investigating, but it doesn’t seem like he is. Well, no matter how strong or weak you are, you will definitely be punished.” “If you keep researching, you will find clues.”

“I hope so.”

Zich, who patted Yoheim, stopped while trying to find the way back.

“Oh, come to think of it, I may be a little late today. Please hold the meeting first with Rouge Young-ae and Mr. Jennard.”

"What's wrong, Mr. Zich?"

“Of the suspects, there is one person who gently evades me. Even if it's a little late today, I'm going to see the end."

"all right. For others, I

Let me talk.”

So the two parted.

Time passed and the sun went down and night came.

However, the moon and stars, which had usually taken the place where the sun had disappeared and shone light, were nowhere to be seen. Thick clouds covered the sky.

Due to the kidnapping incident, there were rare things that were more crowded than usual, so the streets were very crowded.

Zich and his group were crossing the street.

“Damn you! He looks like a genocide, and he has so many fears!”

Zich's murmur echoed through the streets. At that strong tone of voice, it seemed that the dullness around him was fading away.

“He was suspected of being a suspect. If you're scared, it might be."

Lyla was defending the humans who made them sell their feet today, but Zeek snorted.

“Ordinary people wouldn’t know, but it’s a problem because people in the back world do things like that!”

Then, Zich began to preach what the real villain was.

Of course, no one listened, and soon Lyla cut them off and Zich's voice was cut off.

It was on the way back to the dormitory with the group swearing at each other in vain.

Zich, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped. And a little slower than that, Hans and Snock also stopped walking.

"what's the matter?"

Elena panicked and asked Snock who was next to her. However, the reaction of Lyla, who had known Zich for a considerable period of time, was different.

She immediately set up her cane.

“Elena. Take your cane.”

"Yes Yes! Teacher!"

Elena hastily raised her staff.

Sieg and Hans had already pulled out their swords, and Snok also took out some mithrils from the box. Knowwet also growled from Snock's shoulder, unfamiliar to his image.

Lyla asked.

“Are you the culprit?”

“I  think so.”

Zich ran to the roof of a nearby building. I turned my head around to gauge the distance for a moment, and then ran away.

“Follow everyone! Snock! You bring Elena!”

"Yes!"

At Zich's command, Snock transformed Nowem into a large beast. The size of the nowet was large enough for two people to ride.

Snock climbed onto Nowet's back and reached out to Elena.

"ruler!"

“Hey, is this okay?”

Ele while getting on the squat

I was anxious

"do not worry. 'Cause I'll never drop it Right, right?” woo woo!

Contrary to how cute he was when he was small, his cry now was very loud. However, the heaviness of it was felt very reliable now.

“… Then please.”

Elena grabbed Snock's waist.

“Let’s go, now!”

coo

kuung

Knowwet ran towards where Zich ran.

Zich and Hans running up the roofs of the building on their two feet, Lyla flying away, and Snock and Elena riding on Nowem's back.

With a different level of mobility than ordinary people, they were able to get to a place where they could feel their presence quickly.

'He's there.'

Zich witnessed the scene and licked his lips with his tongue.

A man is lying in the alley. It wasn't dead. I was simply losing my mind.

And not far away, a shadow lingered.

A slender arm protrudes from the crouched surface of the shadow.

But for a while. As if being sucked into a deep swamp, his hands were sucked in.

fault!

Zich went down the alley.

'Are there no obstructions this time?'

I vividly remember being disturbed by Gren, so I looked around. Narrow your senses and explore in detail.

' does not exist.'

Zich clenched Windur and said to the party.

“Siege! Make sure you don't miss anything this time!"

Hans and Snock descended on the opposite side of Zich, centering on the shadows. Laila and Elena remained on the roof, pointing their sticks at the shadows.

'great!'

A siege network was also provided. Zich jumped into the shadows.

The moment he was about to swing Windur towards the shadow, he retreated back as fast as he ran.

Koo!

Something slammed into the place where Zich was, making a loud noise. A small crater carved into the ground was visible in the darkness. It was just a shock from a while ago.

'What else is this?'

Zich looked at the guy who ran towards him. It didn't look too disgusting to see the black thing procrastinate.

"•••shadow?"

It was the same figure as the shadow that had just swallowed a person and was procrastinating.

As soon as Zich recognized it, other shadows began to crawl out of the surrounding darkness.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 289 screen

'A lot.'

Zich counted the slowly approaching shadows. More than 30 more than just what you can see .

'It's not just what you see.'

The presence of the surrounding area, which was clean except for civilians until recently, is now being felt a lot.

An ominous and cloudy presence. It is like a sign that the shadow in front of you emits. It literally appears to have fallen from the sky or rose from the ground.

'Well, okay. After all, these guys knew it was difficult to detect.'

It's only besieged. It may be a very dangerous situation for other people, but for Zich, it was just a situation that happened like a meal before returning.

“Zeek! They even showed up on the roof!”

Lyla exclaimed.

“Come down with Elena as well!”

"okay!"

Since we are surrounded, it is better to unite now. Occupying a high ground in battle is good in many ways.

Zich thought he would go up, but the choice was to have Lyla and Elena come down to his side.

There were many reasons, but the biggest reason was the scaffolding.

'If you collapse while fighting on top of a building, it's annoying in many ways.'

The roof of a shabby house in a back alley cannot stand a fierce battle.

Since then, he has been trying to do good things. It had to be avoided as much as possible to collapse the building and draw ordinary people in it into battle.

Of course, when the battle gets tough, there is bound to be damage around it. Just like when I fought Gren a while ago.

'Then I can't help it.'

Zich made a clear conclusion. What is unavoidable is unavoidable.

It was when Lyla hugged Elena and lifted herself up.

The attack of the shadows has begun.

Tuoung! Tuoung!

The movements of the shadows were agile, which did not go well with their procrastination. They flew away and attacked Zich's group.

It flew like arrows to Zich, Hans, and Snock, as well as to Lyla and Elena floating in the air.

Whoo! Whoo!

Zich swung Windur. The traces of the fast and heavy sword were intertwined in the air.

“Aww!”

Seeing the shadows flying towards her, Elena screamed and closed her eyes. But Lyla only glanced at the shadows, but her expression didn't change.

Before the shadows attacked them, Zich's sword flew in.

Whoops! Whoops!

Dozens of shadows bounce off all at once. Above the cleared sky, Lila gently landed next to Zich.

"uh? huh?”

Unable to control the beating of her heart, Elena looked around as if possessed by a ghost.

“Hans! Snock! You guys fight there!”

There was a difference in elevation between the alleys and the roof, but unlike Lyla and Elena, who were close, the distance between Hans and Snock was a bit far.

Because of this, Zich gave such an order to the two of them.

Thanks to their training and experience so far, it was a command they gave in the belief that they could handle it even if they were separated from each other.

"Yes!"

"all right!"

As soon as they were surrounded, the two who had already faced the shadows with their backs answered loudly.

“Lyla! You catch them from afar and kill them! And Elena!”

"Yes Yes!"

“Bring someone over there!”

The person Zich pointed to was a man who had been attacked by a shadow and had collapsed.

He was lying a little away from Zich.

Usually, when one of the lovers was kidnapped, the other was left behind.

However, as long as the battle had taken place like this, he could not choose the option of leaving the person who fell, leaning on the mercy of the criminal.

Moreover, even if the perpetrator continued to neglect him, there was a possibility of injury or even death in the aftermath of the battle.

Elena was perplexed. In a situation where unknown shadows were approaching from all directions, he felt anxious about being separated from Zich and Laila.

Lyla said to Elena.

“Trust us, Elena. And if you want to keep going with us, you have to adapt to this kind of situation. It will also help you improve your skills.”

Elena looked at Lyla and then looked at Snock fighting in the distance.

Contrary to his usual chaotic appearance, he was skillfully engaged in battle using the surrounding land and the mithril he took out.

Elena clenched her wand.

fault!

she ran The shadows procrastinate. Elena suppressed the feeling of wanting to turn around and run away immediately.

He didn't even close his eyes like when he was held by Lyla. Rather, he opened his eyes wide and looked straight ahead.

Tuoung! Tuoung!

The shadows bounced towards Elena. But she didn't stop.

Whoo!

Elena's hair ruffled. It's not because of the jump. Something transparent passed by her.

Koo! Koo!

A mass of compressed air that Lyla fired hit the shadows. The shadows could not approach Elena and bounce back.

“Whoa! Whoa!”

Elena approached the man next to him and caught his breath. But there was no time to rest.

Elena put her arms around the man's armpits.

"profit!"

There is no way that a woman, who always stays at home to study magic, is not strong enough.

Besides, the opponent was a man with a strong physique. Of course, it was not easy to move as Elena.

However, while clenching her teeth and struggling, she managed to drag the man back to where Zich and Laila were.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

Lyla patted Elena's back, breathing heavily in exhaustion of stamina and relieving tension.

"great job."

Elena smiled brightly. But soon after, at the words Zich said, his complexion turned white.

“But you are very weak. Let’s get some physical training from me later.” Although it is said that the journey to Janmalfi was easy because of Elena, Hans and Snock's training continued steadily.

Elena, who had seen the scene in person, had no choice but to be terrified.

Hearing about the training he had received from Snock in the past, he had no choice but to do so.

Elena was about to say something, but Zich had already focused on the battle again.

Koo! Koo! Koo!

Zich deflects all the attacks of shadows from all directions.

The blows were heavy, but they couldn't break through Zich's defense. At the same time, Jiku didn't stop flying his sword.

kuung

A shadow in the distance moved, defending against Zich's attack, and his movements became sluggish. It was a shadow that swallowed a woman.

Unlike the other shadows, Zich was constantly holding back the guy who was trying to run away.

Scratch!

Zich cuts a shadow. Without a scream, the two-sided shadow disappeared as if it was seeping into the air. But I only did one. Another shadow immediately filled the gap.

Zich silently continued swinging his sword. The shadows being dealt with soon became one, two, and then three.

Whoops! Whoops!

The magic that Lyla poured out continuously attacked the shadows in the distance.

Although it is a back alley, it is still a city. Because of that, she could not use huge magic, so she pushed her with the quantity.

The magic that stretched out countless times under Zich's cover attacked the shadows and exploded some.

By her side, she helped Elena with the magic she had just learned.

Hans and Snock also fought well. Estelle Reid's light sweeps across the shadows, and Mithrils entangle them. There were also quite a few shadows that the two of them defeated.

It seemed like only a matter of time before Zich and his party would win.

But the shadows were also suffering, but not.

Whoops!

The shadows retreated all at once. One shadow, who was trying to escape, vomited up the woman and joined the others.

Lyla looked at them suspiciously.

“Are you trying to run away?”

"no."

Zich, coldly unclean, ran towards the shadows. Following Zich's footsteps, the other party continued to attack.

A part of the shadow protruded and defended against Zich's attack. Zich's group's attack stalled for a moment.

Through the gap, the shadows gathered in several places and started to clump together.

The shadows are starting to take shape. It elongated like a crouched person slowly standing up, and parts like arms and legs sprouted out.

The colors that used to be black were gradually becoming more colorful.

“How are you?”

Zich, who had cut off a shadow that blocked him, saw it.

All of a sudden, the shadow took the form of a complete person. He was expressionless and had a slightly darker skin color, but if he hadn't seen the change, no one would have thought that his original form was a shadow monster.

"what?"

Seeing their faces, Zich was surprised.

“Those, maybe… .”

At that moment, the eyes of the shadow humans turned to Zich. Zich instinctively raised his sword.

Aww!

The shadow man's fist approached before he knew it and collided with Zich's sword.

Zich let out a small moan. The shock was different from before.

'I've gotten stronger!'

Zich swung his Windur at the shadow man who was about to pass by him and turn towards Lyla.

The shadow man leaned to avoid it. Zich raised his leg and kicked him.

kuung

Zich's shin collided with the shadow man's forearm. The shadow man flinched back.

“These guys are strong! Stay alert!”

Zich shouted to the group. Fortunately, Hans and Snock survived the sudden reinforcement of the enemy.

But the important thing now wasn't that they got stronger.

“Zeek! The faces of these guys!”

"I know!"

Zich answered Lyla's call.

quaang

Once again Zich and the Shadow Man collide. Zich looked intently into the shadow man's face.

It was a familiar face. It's not just the guy fighting him. All the other shadow humans around me did the same.

never met I only saw it as a portrait.

'Victims of this kidnapping!'

Shadow humans were doing their faces.

“Are you the victim himself?”

Lyla seemed to hesitate. If it was the victim himself, it seemed difficult to attack.

"No way. There may be a connection, but not the victim himself. Rather the opposite. It makes the victims much more likely to die.”

The victims' families and loved ones long and believe that the victims are still alive. It is no exaggeration to say that they are all their hopes.

Zich did not deny that hope.

'However, if a monster in the form of victims appeared like this, the story would be different.'

In Zich's experience, the probability of death was high.

Quang! Quang!

The battle became more intense. Each one is worth it. However, it was also true that it was a little difficult because we were all together.

The number has decreased compared to the previous shadow form, but the ability has risen dramatically.

Zich showed his senses. As if the evacuation was over, there were no signs of anyone nearby.

"Hey!"

Zich called the party out loud.

“There is no one around! You can destroy the surrounding buildings, so use your power!” It's too hard to control the power. Moreover, one grievous concern came to mind as they raised their abilities.

'If the culprit sent these guys because we didn't want to investigate him, guys like these guys could have gone to Joachim and Evelynn.'

Zich loaded Windur with all his power. and swung

Aww!

A strong storm of swords raged in the back alleys of the city.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 290 screen

When Zich was fighting the shadows for a long time. It wasn't just the Zich and the others who were attacked as Zich was concerned.

“Stop it!”

“Get a little more time! Soon a rescuer will come from the city!”

Shouts, swearing, and shouts are heard from outside. There was also the sound of something breaking, the sound of a knife hitting something dull.

And in between, screams of pain and moans mixed with pain.

“Wow!”

“Aww!”

Just by hearing it, you can see just how much pain the screaming party suffers. It soon disappeared mixed with shouts and shouts, but the scream left a clear mark on the listener.

Tuk!

Joheim closed the shutters of the window. All the windows in the room had their shutters closed in case someone shoots an arrow in the dark.

"How is it?"

Evelynn, who was sitting quietly with her hands on the table in the center of the room, asked. Her voice was calm, as if trying to show a resolute attitude. But the clacking fingers on the table showed that she was now quite nervous.

Joheim pondered for a moment. Should I tell the truth or tell a lie to reassure me?

However, those worries disappeared the moment he saw Evelynn's determined eyes.

“Not good.”

he told the truth. Evelynn's fingers moved a little faster.

"i See."

But still her tone was calm.

Joachim fell from the window. I walked to the table and sat across from Evelyn.

“I’m worried about Mr. Zich and his friends.”

Evelynn opened her mouth.

“If we were attacked, there is a good chance they would have been targeted too.”

“That’s right, but I’m not with Mr. Zich. An attack of this size will be enough to repel it.”

“•••I think so.”

she smiles softly Joachim was amazed.

'Daebeom.'

It is usually difficult to expect a noble girl to behave calmly in such a battle situation. I'm lucky if I don't fall into a panic and grab other people's ankles.

But Evelyn was different. There is definitely a sense of irritability. I also feel fear. However, he was still looking for ways to overcome the crisis by suppressing his emotions and grasping the situation.

'If such a person were a wife... .'

If you are the hostess of the current chaotic and chaotic Count Dracule, you need such calmness and boldness. In order to regain the honor of the family and the territory, I have to hold the center of the territory on behalf of Yo Haim, who often goes out of the territory.

But Dracul's thoughts did not last long.

'What's on my subject... .'

The opponent is the young girl of the marquis of a neighboring kingdom. Of course, the Count Dracul's level is not too low.

However, the situation of the Count is the situation. When all of his clan died and there was no heir, the first thing Johaim, who had ascended to the throne, originally had to do was take a wife and leave a heir. However, Jo Haim was still unmarried.

It was a table that best explained how difficult the count's current situation was.

There was not a single nobleman in the same class that would give him a daughter. The same goes for lowering the class by one or two. In this way, he must marry the daughter of a baron who is attached to the corner of the village, or the wife of a wealthy merchant who is neither he nor a nobleman.

Considering the situation of the Dracula family, the daughter of the marquis of the neighboring kingdom was a tree that could not be looked at, let alone climb.

But it was also true that she liked her in many ways.

It was then.

quaang

The building of the dormitory vibrated with a roar. The commotion outside grows louder for an instant. The shout to stop and the groan came through the tightly closed window and delivered to the two of them.

“Looks like it’s broken.”

“I think so.”

Joachim sighed.

“It seems that the enemy is stronger than expected. Even though Mr. Gennard has attracted quite a few enemies.”

When the battle began, Gren had pulled out a certain number of enemies and pulled away from the dormitory, saying that he would ease the burden on Joachim and Evelyn.

“Well, there’s no point in lamenting now.”

After muttering to himself, Yoheim got up and opened the window slightly again to examine the situation outside. A loud roar, which had been flowing so far, is heard.

“Approximately two enemies seem to have successfully infiltrated.”

"is that so?"

Evelynn flipped through her arms. Soon a small dagger was held in her hand.

“You are well prepared.”

“Because I’ve seen bad things before.”

His enthusiasm to pull out his weapon without trembling in fear when an enemy came in was great, but no matter how he looked at it, he couldn't believe that Evelynn could fight so well.

“You run away… No, there is nowhere to run.”

"okay. No matter what the outcome is, we have no choice but to persevere here.”

Yoheim also took out the dagger he was carrying.

“For now, stay behind me.”

“Oh, will you protect me?”

“For now, I will fight better than Young-ae.”

Joheim cut his wrist with a dagger.

c

Blood spurted from his wrist.

“Come on, wait! Count now... !”

Evelynn cried out in surprise, then muffled her lips. The blood spouting from Joachim's wrist was slowly drifting through the air.

“Don’t be surprised. It's my ability."

“•••You have amazing powers.”

“Not a very good ability.”

quaang

Suddenly, the door to the room burst open. Furniture was piled up and down in front of the door to buy some time if there was an intruder, but it didn't seem like it was a big obstacle.

Slurry!

The blood that Johaim squirted opened a thin film to stop the shards from pouring out on them.

Stepping on the fragments of the broken door, two seals enter.

“Those people!”

“Uh… .”

Evelyn and Joheim were perplexed. They, like Zich, recognized the faces of their enemies.

“Count! Aren't they victims?"

“I look like that too.”

However, Joachim did not lower his vigilance. Whether they were victims of disappearances or whatever, they now only see themselves as enemies.

The two shadow men looked at Johaim and Evelynn in turn. And it moved.

Koo!

“Ugh!” The blood that had been spread out roared loudly. The middle of the curtain of blood stretched all the way to Joachim's front. It was because of the fist swung by the shadow man. At any moment, the film of blood seems to be ripped by my fist.

pooong

Joachim slapped the shadow man's temple with a ball of blood the size of a fingernail. The shadow man was thrown aside. However, the desired effect did not come out.

'Even if you hit a vital point, you don't even blink an eye.'

It must be something different from a normal human being.

Another shadow man attacks. Jo Haim clenched his fists.

Koo!

The fist swung by Joheim stopped the shadow man's attack. His fists were covered in a thin layer of blood.

“Wow!”

Joachim frowned. His previous move was not something he could do without intensive training. The body is forced to move through the blood flowing through it. Naturally, blood vessels as well as bones and muscles were damaged. But there was no choice. He continued to forcibly move his body to fend off the shadow men's attacks.

But the more he did, the more his body was injured. The blood was drained to the limit, and I felt dizzy.

Whoops!

The shadow man's hand ripped open his side. I suppressed the scream that came out of me. Fortunately, the wound is not deep. Although the wound area is wide and the bleeding is large, the degree of bleeding can be sufficiently controlled as a person who handles blood.

But it is unavoidable to force it. He took a few steps back.

chin!

Someone put a hand on his back to balance his body.

'You're a young girl, Rouge.'

“The Count. Is that ability, the fatigue of others, impossible?”

“It is possible.”

Since he had only practiced dealing with his own blood, his control over the blood of others was extremely weak, but it was okay for one or two people.

"okay?"

Upon hearing this, Evelynn put the dagger she was holding on her wrist. Her movements paused for a moment when she saw a faint blood on her wrists. However, he soon shut his mouth and tightened the knife to cut his wrist. It didn't work at once, so I tried several more times.

c

Blood gushed from Evelynn's wrist.

“Write this too!”

It's not a back-and-forth situation. Joachim immediately added her blood and opened a curtain of blood.

thud! thud!

The strength of the blood veil has become stronger, so it can block the attacks of the shadow humans a little more easily.

Evelynn stumbled as blood suddenly bled out. But she did not fall.

“Is the Count’s body moving fast, using blood as well?”

"exactly. It is forcing the body to move through the blood inside it.”

“Then can I do that too?”

“You can do it. But, it hurts terribly. With every move, bones, muscles, and blood vessels are shattered. Besides, I will move Rouge Youngae’s body.”

It is a condition that cannot but be avoided. But Evelynn said bluntly.

"Good for you. Anyway, I'm not good at fighting. If the Count moves, I feel comfortable.”

“•••Are you serious?”

“Shall we joke about this situation?”

“••• Got it.”

A thin stream of blood spurted from Joheim's wrist and directed towards Evelyn. The same thing happened to Evelynn's wrist. Soon the blood threads of the two were connected.

Tickle!

Control of Evelynn's body passed to Yoheim.

"I'm just saying, can't the countess control my body forever?"

“Don’t worry. It would be impossible if the thread of blood was not connected as it is now.”

"That's fortunate. Otherwise, I thought I would have no choice but to tell the Count to take responsibility.”

“I think I and my vassals will be warmly welcomed.”

"No. My husband decided that he would make the decision by his own will, not the will of others. Even if I marry Dracula, I will go with my will and two legs.”

“It sounds sweet just to hear it.”

Whoops!

At that moment, the curtain of blood was broken. Yohaim regained control of the blood scattered everywhere and moved Evelynn.

“It will hurt.”

“I promise.”

quaang

Evelynn's body moved rapidly and struck the shadow man. Evelynn's hair was dyed white as she felt her arms crumble. But she clenched her lips and did not scream. Rather, he bluffed looking at Yohaim.

“Ugh, it feels really cool to hit these guys!”

A way of speaking with guts different from the tears that leaked out in pain.

It was the moment when Joheim was completely in love with her.

When Zich's party arrived at the dormitory, the shadow men almost overwhelmed the knights and soldiers guarding the dormitory.

Many soldiers are dead, corpses lying on the floor.

Zich's group just hit the back of the shadow humans.

Aww!

Zich's Windur unleashes a tremendous amount of sword energy. Estelaide's light and undulating earth followed. And the magical bombardment that followed soon finished.

In an instant, the six shadow men behind them were swept away.

But Zich was not satisfied and continued to tease his feet. This was to break through the shadow humans and enter the dormitory to ensure the safety of Yoheim and Evelynn first.

But there was a shadow man who stopped him.

quaang

Windur and his fist clash. Zich's eyes frowned.

'This guy!'

As Zich was about to retrieve Windur and wield it again, the shadow man's feet reached out. Zich raised his sword and blocked it.

Aww!

Zich's body was pushed out. The hand holding the sword is numb. Zich frowned and glared at the shadow man who was blocking him.

He was much stronger than the other shadow humans.

(Continued on next page)

'They're the ones who attacked us.'

Even though it looks like a human, it has a dark exterior that looks strangely faded. Above all, a face that shows no human emotions.

'what?'

Zich looked carefully at the face of the shadow man who was blocking him.

'Isn't that the guy I know?' Sieg memorizes not only the kidnapping victims, but also the portraits of the missing victims when they have not yet been accurately identified as being kidnapped.

However, no one had the appearance of a shadow human in front of him.

is a woman She has a pretty face with brown hair. It was small and slender, and it was an appearance that evoked a protective instinct.

Of course, if you look down on her just by looking at her appearance, your face will be crushed as pretty as the fruit that fell in a typhoon right away.

hooo

The shadow man attacks. Zich

Full of magical power, he swung Windur.

quaang

The sword was clogged in the shadow man's forearm. Windur's sharp blade could not pierce its skin.

'He's not an easy guy to deal with.'

“Hans!”

"Yes!"

Hans, who was engaged in a fierce battle with another shadow man, answered.

“You run right into the dormitory and save the two of them!”

It was enough to feel the battle going on inside.

'It seems to hold up pretty well.'

But it won't last long. It is not the vampires and succubus before the return.

“Lyla! Clear the way!”

"okay!"

Lyla raised her wand. Her lips were sweet. The spells flow at a fast pace. Elena, who was next to her, was startled and unintentionally turned to look at her.

Whoops!

The magic has been activated. The magical energy that escaped from the staff flew gently in a straight line from her toes to the dormitory.

However, the results were never smooth.

Quajiic!

In an instant, everything freezes. It was as if only there had been separated from this fierce and exploding battle space. From the place where Lyla is to the front of the dormitory, a new white space created by the ice of silence was born.

“Wow!”

Elena, overwhelmed by the magic, screams. As a wizard, she could only marvel at Lyla's near-perfect magic.

Hans moved. It runs through the frozen white space with all its power. The shadow humans within the magic range were frozen in extreme cold and were far from other enemies.

quaang

Hans broke the wall of the dormitory and rushed in.

'It'll be fine over there.'

Seeing Estelaide's flashing light inside the dormitory, Zich focused on the shadow man in front of him again.

bang! bang!

As they continued to divide the sword attack, Zich checked the opponent's face.

'It's a face you don't know.'

Maybe there are victims in the city that we haven't been able to figure out? There is no chance of that. However, the shadow man in the form of that unknown victim is far superior to the others in his abilities as well?

'There is a higher probability that this guy is something special than that.'

He twisted his outstretched fist on a blade like a branch of Windur.

Kudouk!

'After all, the bones are not broken or not.'

Far from being broken, the appearance is intact.

'Dirty hard!'

Windur pushed forward. Filled with magic power, he tried to drive the tip of the blade into the shadow man's neck.

Koo!

The shadow man shunned Windur. Aiming for the large gap created by the deflected sword, the shadow man stretched out his hand.

' now!'

In an instant, Zich concentrated his magic power on his feet and turned his body violently. Then he bowed down.

Whoo!

A shadow man's hand glides past his head. The sound alone is powerful. If it fits, a large hole must be drilled in the human body.

However, Zich's nerves were only in his sword. The shadow man's posture collapsed slightly. He swung his sword towards the small gap he saw there.

Get a card!

There was a long scar on the front of the shadow man. A black energy flickered through the wounds. This is a phenomenon that I have already seen enough while cutting down shadow humans.

'next!'

I have no intention of being satisfied with just one wound. It was time for Zich to attack his next attack.

tuung

The shadow man took a long retreat. It landed on a nearby roof. The expressionless gaze turned to Zich.

Sue I

It turned its back. At the same time, all the shadow humans who were fighting near the hostel started to retreat. The shadow humans who were fighting inside the dormitory also came out. As if they had suffered quite a bit from Hans, their bodies were engraved with numerous sword marks, and a black energy was waving.

'Are you going to retreat?'

I have no intention of leaving Zich pursued. The overriding target was the shadow man he had wounded.

Koo!

It blocked Zich's attack and widened the distance once again. It was time for Zich to pursue him again.

Whoops!

The shadow human body exploded.

Black things were scattered everywhere like shards.

'shadow?'

They were the shadows before they became shadow men.

'Are they separated again?'

All the other shadow humans had lost their human form and returned to the shadows. They were heading into the alleys like cockroaches running away from people into the dark.

Windur unleashed magical energy. The sword stretched towards the shadows running away in all directions. A few shadows hit the sword and exploded.

However, no matter how weak they are, the shadow itself is quite strong. Besides, the number has increased.

In the end, more than half survived and disappeared into the darkness of the alley.

Zich ran into the alley.

But, as if hiding in the dark, the shadows had already disappeared. sharpened the senses. But nothing was detected.

'Well, I guess.'

These guys are extremely difficult to detect. If they run away as if they are scattered in all directions like this, there is nothing even Zekra can do.

“Sheesh!”

Zich lightly kicked the ground.

“You are a mess.” Zich, who entered the dormitory, said looking at Yohai. His appearance was fine as if he had used a potion, but just by looking at his messy attire, he could tell how much he struggled.

“After all, rough work doesn’t seem right for me.”

“It looks like you did a great job, though. Both the Count and Young Ae Rouge.”

“Haha, it’s the other way around. Rather, I got help from Rouge Youngae.”

“Certainly, the young Rouge is not the only image to be protected.” Evelyn's appearance is also quite messed up. There were no visible wounds, but the crusts on her hair were probably hers.

“You also used his blood.”

"That's right. So I knew it was even better.”

“Great thing?”

“Didn’t you say that you were testing my abilities?”

“I’ve said that before.”

“When I use other people’s blood, something like thoughts seep into me.”

Since he had never heard of such an exact side effect of Reign of Blood, Sieg was quite pleased with what Yoha Lim had to say.

“When I use the blood of my enemies, all sorts of negative emotions engulf my mind. I can see very well why exploiting this can make you a maniac.”

Even a brief experiment was enough to cause Joheim to vomit and lose his appetite for a while. It's even weirder not to go crazy when you abuse your ability.

“The blood of your allies is better, but it is unavoidable that this is also mixed with thoughts. No matter how much the opponent is the main army, he feels hesitant about using his own blood, the pain of a wound made to bleed, and so on. Well, people like knights who have become accustomed to my abilities and are accustomed to wounds rarely have negative thoughts.”

“But it’s not Rouge Youngae, is it?”

“No. Do you know what the thoughts of her blood were?”

“What is it?”

Joachim smiled.

“Fear, anxiety. But the will not to be broken.”

“Awesome.”

Apparently, Evelynn had achieved great growth from the last incident.

“Yes, that’s great. really."

Joheim praised her with sincerity.

* * *

After talking to Joachim, Zich approached Iblin.

“You suffered.”

“It’s hard. Count Dracule did more of the hard work.”

Evelynn says brightly. However, her pale complexion and slightly trembling tone showed that she had not yet recovered from the shock of the battle.

It seemed that he needed time to calm down right now. The escorts who were close to Evelyn from the side were also urging Zich to retreat with their eyes.

“Get some rest for the time being. Eat warm food and get a good night's sleep. It will help you calm down.”

" Thank you."

It was time for Zich to leave in front of Evelynn.

“How are you, Count?”

Evelyn asked.

“You are fine. Right now, you are moving to identify the site and fix it.”

“You are a strong person.”

Evelynn also helped, but first of all, the subject of the battle was Yoheim. Even if he was injured more than Evelynn, he would have been hurt several times and suffered the same amount of pain. Besides, he wasn't even a knight, even though he used unusual abilities. He didn't seem very used to fighting either. Even so, you're already getting up and moving, wiping away the aftereffects of the battle. It's definitely different from the slightly fragile appearance.

“He is a responsible person. There is also an obligation to reproduce the glory of the family. Above all else, he is a good person.”

While praising Johaim, Zich had goosebumps welling up on his skin. It wasn't that he lied, but it was also a chilling word for Zich, who still had a vivid image of Yo Haim before the return.

"i See."

Evelynn remembered Jo Haim, who was blocking her way. I thought I was dead, but it saved my life.

“Yeah, I think he’s definitely a great guy.”

Evelynn said with a quiet smile.

After meeting two of his former subordinates, Zich came out of the dormitory. It was quite crowded with volunteers arriving. They retrieved the bodies, moved the wounded, and checked the damage.

There was someone passing by.

“Now you are here, Mr. Gennard.”

“It's a little late. You must have arrived first, Mr. Zeek.”

Gren's body and attire were bruised here and there from the battle. However, no major wounds were seen.

“Are Count Dracule and Young Ae Rouge okay?”

“Yes, fortunately. I'm glad that Jennard is doing well too. I heard that the enemies left for some reason.”

“I was able to deal with it. At the end, he suddenly ran away, so I couldn’t handle them all.” So we shared a few words. The two's questions and answers were short, as they were not close friends and deeply hated each other. It's just a formal conversation asking for each other's well-being.

“Who did that magic?”

But even in the midst of this, he said, wondering if he could not hide his curiosity, looking at the magic that had frozen the entire yard of his dorm.

“It’s Lila.”

“Are you referring to the wizard who was with Mr. Zich? Not a new person this time around.”

"That's right."

Gren looked carefully at the traces of the magic.

'It's not your usual skill.'

Gren's eyesight is quite good. In his view, that magic was never a smooth magic. This is especially true considering the age that was guessed by Lyla's appearance.

'He has good skills and looks beautiful.'

Not only is she beautiful, but she is one of the best women he's ever seen.

'Where did you find it?'

But that doesn't really matter.

'Maybe that woman is better than Elena.'

He tried putting Laila in place of Elena in the party he was thinking of. The outward appearance of the composition looked much better.

Gren's thoughts deepened.

(Continued on next page)

The case was settled. Many knights and soldiers have died, but that doesn't mean we can't just mourn. It was necessary to get closer to the truth of the perpetrator by collecting the information obtained from this attack.

'After all, the one I should keep an eye on is the guy I'm dealing with.'

The most powerful shadow human, never seen in the victim portrait. Perhaps the strongest evidence to identify the culprit.

'If we draw a portrait of the guy we saw and search the city, we might find someone we know.'

But time was an issue.

'Perhaps there is a high probability that Gren found the culprit before we found the culprit.'

You can't leave it like that.

It was a time when Zich was contemplating and squeezing out these and other numbers.

“It’s me, Zich.”

Hans spoke.

"Why."

“Something takes a little while. That monster that last fought Zich-sama this time.”

Zich's eyes lit up. Correct your slightly crooked sitting posture and make a chin.

“I think I’ve seen it somewhere.”

"okay?"

A way was opened to confirm the identity of the guy in an unexpected place.

“But I don’t really remember.”

“Have you ever seen it?”

“I guess.”

Hans frowned and continued to wander through the memories that seemed to float.

“Do you think I saw you in this city?”

"no. It’s not Janmalfi, and I don’t think I’ve seen it since I left.”

“Then you saw it at Count Stillwall?”

“It seems so.”

Count Stillwall is different from Janmalfi and the country, far from being a neighbor. But, have you ever seen it there?

When it comes to Earl Stillwall, it's hard for Zich to help. In terms of time, it seems that he has just left Writer Baek, but for Zich, who has returned, his memory of Count Stillwall is a very long time ago.

'Even if I can recall those memories well, it won't be of much help.'

Zich, who was thoroughly a thorn in the eyes of a countess, was stuck in his own space and spent only practicing swordsmanship. I seldom met anyone.

“Once the portrait is complete, I will show it to you first. Seeing your face again might bring back memories.”

"•••portrait?"

Hans wondered if the word portrait reminds him of anything. Are you thinking of something? Zich looked at Hans with anticipation.

“Oh, I remembered!”

Hans exclaimed.

“I definitely remember seeing a portrait of him in the Count!”

"portrait? Haven't you seen it yourself?"

"Yes. When I was educated at the count, I once memorized portraits to remember the impressions of many nobles. I saw it then.”

In order to prevent the servants from being rude and not recognizing the other nobles, the nobles have their key servants memorize all the portraits of the other noble families.

'This guy was a guy who put a lot of effort into educating the countess, so he must have memorized that much.'

But it didn't matter.

“So what kind of guy is he?”

That's what's important now.

“I have grown a little more mature than the portraits I have seen, but Sia Rubrenter.

It’s like a little girl.”

“Young-ae, Viscount… .”

Why is the daughter of the noble family of the neighboring kingdom mentioned in Janmalfi? That too is a clue that can identify the culprit in the kidnapping case.

“Do you know anything more about that young girl?”

"sorry. Other than that, I don't know. Because that's all I've been taught not to be rude if we just happen to meet somewhere... .”

'Hey, he was in the middle of learning about his job, and he dragged me along.' But that alone helped a lot. Besides, right now, there is no one beside him to ask about Sia Rubrenter.

"Well done. It was helpful enough.”

"Yes!"

Are you happy to be of help? Hans replied loudly.

* * *

After the raid, the meeting continued. It was by no means the kind of people who didn't show up at the meeting because everyone in the meeting was afraid of being attacked. Rather, he was trying to catch the culprit and burned his will. Therefore, the heat of the meeting was much more intense.

But that wasn't the only thing different from usual.

'That's over there again.'

Zich muttered to himself as he saw Gren talking to Lyla.

not suddenly Gren wasn't the only one talking about meetings. Occasionally we chatted privately. I even talked to Zich.

However, since the raid, the frequency of talking to Lyla has increased slightly, although subtle.

'Are you interested?'

Considering Lyla's appearance, it's not unusual. It was her appearance that could easily appeal to any man.

'But the question is like some kind of hoboshi.'

He is secretly asking about Lyla's birthplace or how she lived. Isn't it something else to usually ask someone you have a crush on?

But Lyla isn't the one to answer that question. And he didn't seem to want to answer. Gren didn't get much of a harvest.

After the meeting, Joachim and Gren left the dormitory. Evelynn went back to her room.

Zich said to Laila, who was still in Zich's room.

“Our genius mage caught another poor man, didn’t he?”

“Don’t be silly.”

Zich giggled at Lila's reaction.

“But it’s also true that he does talk to you on a sneak peek.”

Lila gave her a slightly offended expression.

It's not like she's very suspicious of Gren like Zeeg. However, she had to be suspicious of Gren in her own way, as she could not help being influenced by Zich's negative opinions while traveling with Zee. Besides, it's not logical that Zich doesn't like him.

Usually, people who are close to them hate people who are not very fond of them. That was exactly the way Lyla looked at Gren.

Because of this, she was quite reluctant to associate with Gren.

'Is that guy, did he start targeting Lyla?'

While teasingly teased Laila, Zich thought.

‘Because Elena, who was suspected of being his target, came in here. If you think that Elena will find a replacement for her, it makes no sense.'

Considering Lyla's beauty and skills, it's worth trying a few stabs.

'Then what are you asking about the past? It's not like I'm trying to seduce you from the beginning by doing one more regression... !'

Jack's movements stopped. He tapped his lips with his finger, recalling the thought that just came to him.

'One more regression?'

I doubted that Gren had made a comeback. I guessed that he probably regressed in a different time zone than Zich.

'By the way, just because I did a regression once doesn't mean that he would have done it only once.'

Zich looked at Lyla. I remembered that these were the memories of the future that Lyla had been insisting on. Zich saw it as a kind of possibility. But what if it's not a possibility, but something that happened before the return that Zich doesn't even remember?

Moreover, if that were the case, even the dream of Zich himself became suspicious.

'Someone would laugh at it.'

But Sieg experienced the ridicule.

'If so, how many times did he return?'

third time? four times? No, it could be ten, twenty, or more than three digits.

'Can a regression guy control it at will? Otherwise, does it happen naturally under certain conditions?'

Doubt bites its tail.

'One thing is certain, until you know for sure, you can't torture Gren Jennerd to get information.'

If he freely manipulates the power of regression, if he finds himself in an unfavorable situation, he is sure to turn back time.

'Damn, if that's the case, I don't have an answer either.'

Zich scratched his head. The fraudulent nature of regression was well known by Zich, who had experienced regression. The difference between the self in the present age before the return and the self after the return is literally the difference between heaven and earth. But do you control such a regression at will?

'It's a huge advantage.'

After a long time, after a really long time, Zich felt a sense of darkness. Even if you use various numbers to win, isn't it over if you regress? In addition, it is easy to plan countermeasures by knowing all about how the opponent will turn out when they return.

Ordinary people would have given up on daring to oppose them. You can live your life just hoping that what you imagined isn't a reality.

But it wasn't Jack.

'Well, that's the worst.'

Giving up without even trying is not in Zich's taste. Besides, it wasn't confirmed that it was the worst situation. Above all, if Sieg's suspicion is correct, there is a high possibility that Gren belonged to a person or group who played with his life.

'You can't just skip it!'

However, since there is a possibility that a serious threat exists, we cannot be hasty. First, you need information. And Zich knew a clue to finding that information.

'Cloone.'

It seemed that we should do some research on the ancient empire a little sooner.

“Are you done thinking?”

Lila asked when Zich had come to a conclusion.

“Roughly. Did you have tea?”

“It’s not like I see you in a day or two. You know that. Okay, what were you thinking?”

I couldn't tell you everything because I was still hiding things about the return from Lyla. Above all, the suspicion that the demon king mentioned in his dream was Laila did not dissipate.

“About the connection between Gren Gnome and Cloone.”

Because I only told part of the facts. Lyla nodded as if she had no doubts.

That was then. A knock was heard.

“Mr. Zich, this is Evelynn.”

“Come in!”

Zich got up and met Evelynn. Leila followed Zich and stood up.

Evelyn opened the door and entered the room.

“Mr. Lyla is already here. No, were you still there after the meeting was over?”

“I have something to tell you.”

“Again, they are very affectionate with each other.”

Evelynn said with a strange smile. Lila sighed slightly.

“We are not like that.”

“Oh, who said what? It meant that it was good to see the friendship between co-workers.”

Evelynn smiled and sat down on the empty seat. Her face was full of playfulness. Perhaps, once the conversation begins, the mischief will keep coming, so Lyla's head hurt a little.

Zich and Laila sat down and the real conversation began.

“Then why did you call me, sir? I don't think we're talking about chatting or flirting, did you find any clues?"

Evelynn's expression became serious.

“No, it is right to chat and chat.”

Evelynn blinked.

“There was an unfortunate incident a while ago, and you received a lot of help from Young-ae Rouge. Besides, you are not able to tour properly because you have come to a tourist destination. It seems like you like to talk with us, so I thought it would be nice to have these kind of meetings from time to time.”

“Oh, is that so?”

Evelynn's eyes lit up.

“Then there is no reason for me to refuse.” And Evelynn opened her mouth vigorously.

So the three of them started chatting. Conversations were usually led by Zich and Evelynn, often with Lyla intervening. She teased and laughed out loud at Lyla, or listened to Zich's story with excitement.

That was when the story was ripe.

“By the way, what has happened to the Kingdom since then?”

Zich slowly broke his luck.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 293 screen

“What about the kingdom?”

"Yes."

“By the way, Mr. Zich was a Steelwall Bag writer, wasn’t he?”

“There have been times like that  .”

No joke, Zich never thought about the count.

It was before his return that Zich cut off his relationship with the Count. Besides, after returning, didn't he even turn it over once and come out?

Now, there was no reason to embrace the longing or rekindle anger.

It was only to the extent that, if serious problems arise later, it would be enough to help out at least once in consideration of my mother's debt.

“ O  ”
“S’ •

Evelynn glanced at Zich's eyes. The light of contemplating whether I should talk about this or not was intense.

'I don't think it's a very good situation.'

“If it’s hard for you to talk, you don’t have to. I'm no longer affiliated with the Earl of Stillwall, so I don't care what the situation is.”

She carefully opened her mouth at Zich's words.

“If you think so, that’s fine. But it's not that serious. I don't even know exactly. It's just that I'm having a bit of trouble with the succession issue."

'It looks like he's not doing it right.'

Could it be that I can't get out of the trauma of the old blood battle?

'Anyway an incompetent guy.'

Seek giggled at the misfortune of his younger brother, who looked down on him.

'But I've decided to help out once, so should I go help?'

But Zich soon denied it.

'You won't have to help me yet. Even if you ask for help, they won't accept it.'

If it weren't for the moment when the Count really stumbles, Count Stillwall would never have Zich's help.

'If you're in a really dangerous situation, you should do it then.' Of course, we may not be able to get the information in time that Earl Stillwill is in danger. No, you probably won't get it.

But Zich had no intention of doing any more than that. If Count Stillwall disappeared like that, that would be all.

Zich's thoughts on the Earl of Stillwall didn't end there.

Zich responded appropriately to Evelynn's words and turned around. In the first place, this place was not created because of Earl Stillwall's situation.

Evelynn easily followed Zich's words, whether he was reluctant to continue Count Stillwall's negative comments in front of Zich.

It was time to talk about this and that about the Cronon Kingdom.

Zich sneakily asked about the nobles of the kingdom. In a way, you might be mistaken for something like a spy.

However, Sieg's questions were purely gossip-like, politically non-dangerous ones, and his eloquent eloquence added to it, making it feel like nothing more than chatter between acquaintances.

Of course, it is impossible as an aristocrat to share the story of gossip with the common people.

However, Zich's origin is Guy, Earl of Stillwall, and Lyla is a talented wizard who deserves the title of nobility immediately if he commits himself to a certain country.

Because of this, Evelynn considers the two of them like half aristocrats, so they can talk without much thought.

The atmosphere was somewhat mellow. Zich began to ask serious questions.

“By the way, does Young Ae Rouge know the author of Rubrente?”

“Are you the author of Rubrenter?”

The name of the noble family that suddenly popped out.

“Oh, I remember.”

Without even thinking about it, Evelynn answered. It was too fast for Evelynn to remember for a sudden topic.

There are two possibilities. You are usually close friends, or if there was an incident that caused a lot of buzz just by saying the name of your family.

“It’s a family that once became a hot topic among the aristocrats.”

Zich's eyes lit up. I may have pinpointed it very accurately.

“That is interesting. What was the topic?”

“Oh, you don’t know? That must have happened when Mr. Zich was in the family? He was also quite famous in the social world.”

“Because I wasn’t treated well when I was in the family. Most of them were confined to their homes and spent only training. So, I don't know much about rumors in the social world.

"Ah...."

Evelynn looked at Zich once more. However, when Zich's expression did not change, he was relieved a little and continued the conversation.

“Well, then you might not know. Although it has become a topic of discussion, it is not a topic that has been burned so large that even people who are not interested in it know it. What I remember well was that it was gossip I was interested in.”

It seemed to be one of the many gossips that flowed and disappeared in the social world.

"what is that?"

“Among Viscount Rubrenter’s daughters, there was a woman named Sia Rubrenter.”

Got exactly the answer I wanted. Zich pushed Evelynn's next words with an interesting expression. Lyla, who had already heard of Sia Rubrenter's existence in advance, also listened.

“I have never seen it in person. I've only heard some stories. It is known that he died of an illness a few years ago. But at that time, strange rumors circulated in the social circles. He didn't die of an illness."

"then?"

“You said you ran away from love.”

Another very interesting story came out.

“A love escape?”

"Yes!"

It's definitely something Evelynn would like. She was excited and continued to speak.

“The Viscount Rubrenter denied it, but the news spread. Of course, the rumors did not last long because it was difficult to confirm the facts.”

“Can I know exactly what the rumor is about?”

“As is the case with gossip in the social world, there is no accurate information. It's just that the young girl, Viscount Shea Rub Rent, fell in love with a servant and ran away. Of course, there was a lot of fat in it, so there were rumors about it, but as far as I know, the most accurate information is what I said.”

“It’s like a novel.”

"Yes. But everyone argued that there was no possibility of a happy ending like a novel.”

“Why?”

“It is rumored that Viscount Rubrenter is quite tenacious. Besides, when I met him a few times before, he was a man of great pride as a nobleman. Such a person cannot leave his daughter and servant on the run for love. He must have tracked it down somehow.”

“So is it.”

“Besides, what is the realistic chance that the servants and nobles will escape and make a living? When I think about it, it doesn’t hurt, but I can’t believe the future is going to be good.”

After that, Zich spoke with Evelyn for some more time.

After some time passed, Evelyn stood up. It's time to go to bed slowly. Satisfied with the conversation, her eyes were wet with weary, but her face was vivid. After leaving a message saying that she would have another time like this, she went back to her room.

Leila, the only man in the room, opened her mouth.

“I got some pretty good information.”

"okay."

Like Zich's answer, Evelynn's information was very useful.

“I thought that I might not be able to get accurate information because I was turning it around so I wouldn’t get caught, but I got more good information than I thought.”

"That's because you're so good at talking back and forth."

Although she had a lot of knowledge, Lila was not able to lead the conversation she wanted as slyly as Zich.

“It is the product of constant hard work and talent.”

Lila lightly ignored Zich's self-congratulations.

“Anyway, I don’t think Evelynn Rouge felt anything more than you thought. Your plan went well.”

“Gren Jennard doesn’t know that this is how we learned about the existence of Sia Rubrenter.”

This is the reason why we went round and round to talk to Evelyn about what should be openly asked. If you tell Joachim or Evelynn about the existence of Sia Rubrenter, Gren will get information right away, and he may hit the player when he feels threatened.

However, if information is extracted in this way, Gren will not notice that Zich has obtained new information.

'It's possible to deceive Yoheim and Evelynn, but for now, the priority is to hit Gren in the back of the head.'

Zich listed the information he had obtained in the past and the information he obtained this time.

“A man and a woman who loved each other enough to escape in love. The culprit is probably someone who has lost a loved one. And the shadow man took the form of Sia Rubrent.”

Putting this information together, we have one culprit.

said Lyla.

“Is the servant who ran away in love with Sia Rubrent the culprit?”

“It will most likely be. But now it doesn't matter where the culprit is from."

“Well, it doesn’t matter where you are now. There is a high possibility that they are deceiving their identity as they are from where they came from. I don't even know what it looks like."

"okay. But one hypothesis was put forward.”

Lyla looked at Zich.

“The clues from Gren Jennerd are sure to be long, but there must be some kind of trap hidden there.”

“You said so.”

“So that’s it, Lyla. Let's say you made a love escape. And the one who pursues you is a father who never admits his love and is persistent.”

Lyla frowned.

“•••Can't you imagine?”

“Still, give it a try. In that situation, of course, you should hide your identity. But up to that point, of course, the father would expect it too. You need more than just hiding your identity. But that doesn't mean the two of you will fall apart. Because love cannot be separated from people who run away from each other.”

Lila was lost in thought.

“Because it’s love’s escape, the two of us should stay together. But nonetheless, it is something that the pursuers will not suspect. Are you hiding in a back alley?”

"and? Would that be enough?”

“Of course I will do things like disguise. I can't change or change my identity. The runaway servants and noble maidens will not be able to immediately acquire the status of a commoner or higher. then… .” At that moment, Laila looked at Zich as if thinking of something.

“••• Pretending not to be your lover?”

Zich smiled meaningfully.

"how?"

“The two are not going to fall apart. They even ran away from love. I can't even introduce myself as a couple. Then , siblings?”

Zich snapped his finger as if it was the correct answer.

“It would be better to add the word 'sick' to it, whether it was a sister or a sister. Apparently, Sia Lubrent, who was cut down by her beggars as a nobleman, will stand out in the eyes of others. I’m going to cut myself off from the outside as much as possible.”

“If that guess is correct, there would be no point in investigating the person who had a lover.”

"okay. To other people, they look like good brothers and sisters, not lovers.”

Zich brought a pile of papers from one side of the room. It was the profile of the suspects we looked at before, but not the most likely suspects.

“When investigating the suspects, they also did a simple family investigation.”

Zich handed over the papers one by one. Then he pulled out a sheet and pushed it in front of Laila.

"this person is… .”

“I am the owner of the casino.”

Clearly, he was a man with a sharp scar in his three hundred eyes.

“Look at your family.”

Lyla turned her gaze to the part Zich was talking about.

He had no family. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been a family in the past.

“… Did you have a sister?”

"okay. And that sister is already dead.”

Jack chuckled.

“If you think that this guy is the servant and the dead sister is Sia Rubrent, isn’t it quite fitting?”

“Did you say you never had a girlfriend? It seemed so on the outside because it did not sagwiji been the lover's sister lovers actually also likely  think I'll? "

"right."

Zich said, poking his finger in the face of Kendel Isid, the owner of the casino.

“Tomorrow, let’s investigate this guy and his younger brother. As the guy said, is he the owner of the casino, who has no interest in real women and only has the fact that he lost his sister in the past, or is he really a bastard who is kidnapping only lovers. There will be outlines.”

The next day, Zich headed to the casino. I took Laila and stood in front of the big door of the casino. It came out quite early, but the casino was already in business.

“Be very diligent.”

As Laila murmured as she watched the people entering the casino, Zich said.

“Time is a trivial matter to a gambler. There are people who even put their own lives behind gambling. In a way, they are poor people.”

“ Anyone of  those people winning money?”

“Never. Even if there is a day to win a little, I will invest in gambling again. And you will lose again. Casino gambling is unconditionally beneficial to the casino side.”

Zich and Lila entered the casino. As soon as I entered, the atmosphere filled with desire and excitement rushed over me.

“Then shall we play properly?”

“Lost money?”

“Today you will have a daughter.”

“I hope that lie is true.”

The two split. And each moved to play the game they wanted.

Of course, gambling was not the goal. In order to investigate Con del Isid, he decided that it would be better to start with this casino, which he also runs. In short, it was an information survey.

For once, the two pretended to gamble. As before, Zich's money gradually disappeared. He looked no different from the people around him who were concentrating on gambling, shouting and swearing with their red eyes.

But he was truly unaffected by the madness of gambling. Unlike the people who were engulfed in excitement, Zich's eyes were cold.

Gambling progressed to some extent, and the amount Zich lost increased considerably. Jack sighed heavily. It's like people see. And I fell back as if to rest for a while. On the way, I approached the wall with a drink offered by the casino.

“It’s been a long time.”

Zich said, leaning his back against the wall. Next to him was a bodyguard who stood like a stone statue and watched the surroundings. it's a familiar face He was once the bodyguard that Zich gave Kendell Isid directions to.

His face contorted slightly. No matter who you look at, it's a form that doesn't like talking to Zich. But, obviously, there was also a feeling of embarrassment mixed in that expression.

Zich laughed bitterly.

“It seems strange to suddenly use respect and be polite, unlike before.”

“No, what… .”

The bodyguard stuttered.

Zich's words were piercing the corner. The bodyguard was a little confused by the difference between the old Jeeke, who was flirting and slurping half a word, and the now polite Joe Gonjogon.

“Last time it was work. When it comes to work, there are things that you have to deal with unintentionally. I think you will be able to relate to some extent because this is what you are doing.”

“Well, it is.”

The bodyguard easily affirmed because there were a lot of things to do with casino customers who lost money and were busy.

“Then why didn’t you come to work today?”

“If I had come to work, I would have visited Mr. Ysid right away. I'm just here to cool off. My head was on the verge of an explosion because of the case I was assigned to.”

Jack smiled a little.

“So there is no need to keep watching with such suspicious eyes.”

“Wow!”

The bodyguard, who was constantly monitoring after finding Zich, coughed in vain. But when Zich didn't look very displeased, he calmed down a little.

But still, I had to apologize. As long as he gambles at the table, Zich is a guest of the casino. Moreover, he knows that Zich has devoted a significant amount of money to the casino today.

“I’m sorry if you were offended.”

“I didn’t mean to ask for an apology, but if you feel guilty, please talk for a while. If I go back to the table right now, I think I'll lose again. I need some time to recharge my luck.”

“As long as it doesn't interfere with your work, that's fine. And please make it as short as possible.”

Zich talked with the bodyguard. Gambling, gambling, talking about customers coming to the casino, etc.  And after a while, Zich sneakily spoke up.

“But your boss.”

The guard's gaze changed. So far, he's been very good at answering me, even though he seems like a troublesome attitude at first glance. They didn't want to be caught because of Zich's identity and the act of monitoring him. However, it is a different story when the topic of the president's personal life comes up.

“•••Do you have anything to say to the boss?”

“Don’t be nervous. did you say Oh, I guess I'm just here to cool off. I just have a personal question for you.”

“••• What is it?”

“The boss here. Why don't you have a lover?"

" Yes?"

To the bodyguard who did not know much about the incident, Zich's question was a very personal question that had nothing to do with the incident.

To the bodyguard who answered with a shaky answer, Zich asked like a gossip gossip-loving gossip.

“Honestly, the boss here is not a smart enough person, is it? To run a casino like this in the tourist city of Janmalfi, you usually don’t have the skills.”

“It is.”

“I think that would be enough for one or two women.”

In response to Zich's question, the bodyguard nodded inwardly. That was the question he had. If he were the president of such a casino, he would have lived a very nice and glamorous life. However, he knew a man named Kendell Isid who, in a way, was even considered ascetic.

“There’s no such thing as a hidden lover, right?”

“As far as I know, none.”

“He’s such a great person. Are you that passionate about your business? Well, there are often  people like that . Or do you have no lover because you have a deep affection for your family? There was such a case... .”

Zich muttered and asked a question.

“Did your boss care about your family?”

“The boss has no family.”

“I know that. I had a younger sister who also passed away recently. I'm asking about her story before she passed away."

"well."

Did I go in a little too deep? It was time for Zich to turn around a bit.

“Now that I think about it, I think I’ve heard those words.”

The bodyguard opened his mouth.

“Now, it seems like most of them live and work in casinos, but back then, they had their own homes, and they almost always went to work like a knife. I heard that the reason was to take care of my sister. It is said that the younger sister was weak enough to not be able to go out often. Although he is a rough man from a back alley, seniors said that the friendship between siblings is really good.”

"Is that so?"

I got the answer I wanted. Jack smiled contentedly inwardly.

After some more chatter, Zich turned his back on the wall.

“It took too much time with a busy person.”

"no."

Contrary to the words, however, the bodyguard's face showed the feeling of being finally freed. But Jack didn't say anything. Rather, he returned to the gambling table with a happy expression.

And all day, Zich repeated the act. I lost some money in gambling and occasionally chatted with the staff around me. There were people who couldn't get much information, but there were people who came up with good information.

Slowly it was evening, and Zich and Lyla left the casino. By the time they came out, the casino was still crowded.

“Have you got any information?”

Jack asked.

“It seems to be true that Kendell Isid was extremely fond of being his younger sister.”

“Oh, did you find out? Are you good at extracting information?”

Zich said as he recalled the experience of twisting words around to loosen the guards' boundaries. However, Lyla's words were not what they expected.

“Did you just tell me when I asked?”

Zich looked at Lyla. The ultimate beauty that transcends human beings. Just walking along the road takes the attention of those around you. Apparently, as long as the bodyguards were men, they couldn't defend against Lyla's fatal attack.

'Anyway, this guy's world is unfair.'

He felt that all his efforts to lower his boundaries and obtain information were meaningless.

'Anyway, the certainty of the information has gone up, so that's good.'

From that day on, Zich continued to gather information. We explored the casino and the back alleys to find out about Kendell Isid. And there were rumors that he cared for his little sister to an unusually high degree.

“Do you think this guy is right?”

Lyrado Condel Isid was highly likely to be the culprit.

“Don’t you think it’s okay to start a forced investigation soon?”

“Not yet.”

“Is there anything else I need to do? A portrait of a shadow man presumed to be Sia Rubrenter was also prepared.”

Through the shadow man they witnessed, her portrait was already drawn.

“You have to do it, yes. That is also very important.”

"What?"

To mention that Zich is important. Lyla asked nervously.

“Ready to bully him.”

"•••what?"

For a moment, Lila thought she had heard it wrong. But Zich said without even changing his complexion shamelessly.

“Prepare to bully Ysid. Did you really think that I would leave the enemy alone?”

“… No.”

Weren't you already familiar with Zich's nasty hobbies? If you were really steady, you were a steady person.

But Lyla thought so for a while. Seeing Zich's face, Lila felt a little different this time.

“Geek.”

"Why?"

“Are you mad?”

Lila glances slightly. Zich's expression didn't look any different than usual. cheerful and confident However, a slight sense of alienation did not leave her mind.

“… Do you have tea?”

Zich rubbed his face to and fro.

“It’s not that bad. It’s just how I feel.”

"okay?"

Zich removed his hand from his face.

“Are you angry? For what?”

“Joachim and Evelynn.”

As the names of the two came out of Zich's mouth, Lila noticed.

“Oh, because those two were attacked?”

"right."

“… But right now, the relationship between you and those two is not that deep.”

"know. Now, those two aren't the subordinates of the Demon King Siegmore. I didn't become a vampire or a succubus, and I will continue to live my life as Count Joheim Dracule and Marquis Evelynn Rouge, not as a Demon. It won't have anything to do with me. No matter how good the relationship is, it would be like an acquaintance with grace.” Jik, who said that far, laughed. Laila swallowed her saliva. It's not your usual playful laugh. The Demon King Siegmore that Lyla is so afraid of. It was close to that laugh. If Hans and Snock had been around, they would have immediately set their boundaries to the maximum and noticed Zich.

“But what about the fever? And I don't have to be patient, do I?"

Zich looked back. In the distance you can see the casino they came from. There will be Kendell Isid in it.

“So you have to. Plenty until I like it!”

Lila instinctively took a step away from Zich.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 295 screen

It was always a meeting time. As always, the meeting proceeded calmly and calmly. But the atmosphere was quite heavy.

Incidents keep happening and they have even been attacked directly. However, the culprit has not yet been properly found.

That is why the words Zich said had a huge ripple effect.

“We have found a person who is likely to be the culprit.”

At that time, the faces of people were worth seeing.

Lyla, who knew everything before and after, felt like 'I finally said it', but the others looked at Zich with their eyes wide open like a rabbit that had been slapped in the back of the head.

However, in the midst of the terrifying gazes pouring on him, Zich calmly took out the portrait and profile he had kept in his arms and placed them on the table.

“Condell Isid. He is the man who runs the casino in Janmalfi. It's still in the suspicious stage, but I personally think it's certain. So I would like to ask for the right to compulsorily investigate this man's house and casino, Count."

“Oh, wait a minute.”

As if he couldn't keep up with the situation, Yo Haim raised his hand and stopped Zich's words for a moment.

“Do you think this person is the culprit?”

"That's right."

Joheim looked at the profile.

“I am not a prime suspect.”

“Yeah, it was on the suspect line, but one of the elements of the culprit we thought was missing, so it wasn’t included in the prime suspect.”

“What was missing?”

“I had no lover.”

"Hmm."

As if he had already escaped from the nursery rhyme, Joheim looked down at Kendell's portrait with a rather cool eye.

“Well, the impression is definitely like a criminal.”

Joachim tapped Kendell's portrait with his index finger.

“But Zeek-nim wouldn’t have accused this person of being the culprit just for that reason, so there must be a reason, right?”

"That's right. It's a bit embarrassing to put aside the culprit we agreed upon and then suddenly say someone else is a suspect.”

Gren also intervened. His face is full of embarrassment. Maybe it's because he found a culprit that only he should know.

But, as he said, it's not that Zich doesn't seem to be puzzled by the sudden accusation of someone they didn't expect as the culprit.

“To be precise, it’s not that I didn’t have a lover. It just looked like it wasn't there.”

“•••I will have to listen carefully to the explanation.”

“Of course, Count.”

And Zich slowly began to explain why he had blamed Kendell Isid.

Of course, some seasoning was basic. Because I had to get rid of things like doubts about Gren.

As Zich's explanation continued, people's mouths opened.

In particular, when it was said that Kendell Isid had escaped in love with Sia Rubrenter, Evelynn had no choice but to make a sound without knowing whether it was an exclamation or a scream.

When Zich finished explaining, there was a moment of silence in the room.

“•••So, to sum up what Zich said, Kendell Isid is a servant who escaped in love with the Viscount Sia Lubrenter, and to hide it, she pretended to be a brother and sister with the Viscount Louvrenter.”

"That's right."

“That’s why people didn’t know he had a girlfriend.”

“If you instill in people the perception that they are brothers and sisters, unless you show too much affection in front of others, you will only perceive that they are good siblings.”

“Is there any evidence?”

“I am asking for a compulsory investigation right to investigate it. However, there is no evidence at all.”

Zich pulled out another portrait. It was a portrait of the shadow man that Zich fought.

“This is a restored portrait of the monster I fought. I took this and explored the people around Ishid. I usually hid my sister so tightly that no one really knew her face.”

As if he had suffered a lot, Zich shook his head exaggeratedly.

“Fortunately, I was able to find a priest who lightly prayed for Kendell Isid's brother when he died. It seems that the portrait and the face of the younger sister at the time are somewhat similar. Wouldn't this be enough to receive the right to compulsory investigation?”

“•••It is, though.”

Joachim blurted out his words. There was a shadow on his face. He seemed to be in a bad mood, but more than that, he seemed to have a greater sense of not knowing why.

They couldn't understand why Zich didn't tell them this important information.

'Evelynn and more.'

Pom, who is staring at him with all his power with his eyebrows raised, seems to be holding on to the desire to shake Zich by the neck right now.

She also told me that she had information about Sia Rubrenter, so she must have felt betrayed.

"great."

said Joachim.

“It’s well worth knowing. Let's ask for the right to compulsory investigation. Perhaps at this level, the request will certainly be granted.”

After that, Sieg and Joachim talked for a while. That was when the opinion to investigate the casino of Kendell Isid was over.

“Then is the conversation over?”

Evelynn's hoarse voice is heard. Joachim flinched.

Evelynn's power was so great that he flinched as he ran around to save the family that was on the verge of bankruptcy.

Evelyn's face was smiling. However, the chill emanating from her unbelievably beautiful smile seemed to freeze the surroundings at any moment.

'Oh, you look like the guy from the succubus?'

However, Zich, the target of the cold, had only such carefree thoughts.

“Mr. Zich.”

“Why are you like this, Princess?”

“Are we meeting and exchanging opinions?”

" Yes."

“Then why didn’t Zeek teach us such important information?”

She was so angry that her tone became sharp without realizing it.

Joheim's gaze also turned to Zich. He doesn't express his anger like Evelynn, but he wasn't too different from her thoughts.

“Because there may be spies.”

Jack said lightly. However, the weight of those words was different from what it has been until now.

Zich glanced at the people in front of him. No, to be precise, I pretended to be like that and looked at Gren.

He also had a very surprised face. But it's not even more surprising than necessary.

When he heard Zich's conversation, he only had a surprised expression on his face to the extent that he wondered if he should have been surprised that much.

“… Does that mean you doubt us?”

In earnest, Evelynn's words began to displease her. An expression of emotion that is different from the past.

Zich just cut it out and said.

"no."

'Except Gren.'

The back words were swallowed inwardly.

Evelynn, who was about to say something again, raised her hand to stop him, and Zich said.

“I was going to tell you this anyway. We were attacked not long ago.”

"Yes."

In place of the excited Evelynn, Joachim answered.

“Then why were we ambushed?”

“Isn't that the door because we're digging for the culprit?”

“But we're not the only ones looking for criminals. The whole city is on the hunt for the culprit. Rather, we are nothing more than collaborators working with the city from the outside. It is also a small collaborator with only a few people. But why did the criminal attack us?”

If you think about it, yes. Not only Yoheim, but Evelynn also changed their faces seriously.

“Is it difficult to touch the main forces of the investigation, such as the mayor or the army of the city? Killing non-main factions doesn't stop the hunt for the perpetrators. I don't think the speed of investigation is going to drop that much either. to scare you? The city's rulers are not intimidated by just that. Rather, as long as the road does not run wild, it is all right.”

“Isn’t that because we made a number of useful comments?”

Evelyn said. Her voice suddenly returned to normal.

“I think so. But how did the culprit know we had an opinion?”

“Rumors… .”

“That’s not it, young Rouge.”

Joachim denied it.

“The rumors didn’t spread. The opinions we propose are not enforced in our name. It's just an order from the city. There's no reason to gossip."

“•••So you mean very few people know that we have an opinion'?”

"exactly. That would be the people involved in this investigation. Not because it’s important information, but because it’s not a story worth spreading.”

"That's right."

Zich groaned.

“But I don't think he's a huge spy like he's trying to get some very important secrets. I think it might be just about paying money and omitting information flowing inside the city.”

“That is bad enough.”

Joachim said displeasedly. The subordinates who were bought with money from him, who was running his own family and estate, were like parasites.

No, it was emotionally more disgusting than that.

“That’s why I kept it a secret.”

“But you can tell us.”

Evelynn's demeanor was very softened. Because they knew it wasn't that Zeek didn't trust them.

But her face had to be contorted again.

“To hide it thoroughly. “It’s okay to say, ‘It’s okay because my surroundings are reliable.’”

So far it's been fine.

“Well, there was a reason why it was bothersome to tell.”

“… Mr. Zich? Would you like to talk to me alone next time?”

"Hahaha! Rouge Young-ae's beauty freezes her body and she doesn't seem to know what to do, so I'll refrain from doing it."

“You would never do that!”

“People don’t know.”

Suddenly, the atmosphere in the conference room was relaxed. The jokes came and went, and smiles crossed the people's faces.

But only one. Grenman was different. He, too, is smiling as if the scene in front of him is interesting.

But his aura was like a drop of oil on water, and it couldn't mix with the warmth that flowed around him.

* * *

“Finally, this case will be over.”

When the meeting was over and everyone went home, Lyla remained in Zich's room as she always did.

“If Joachim gets the compulsory investigation right, are you going to attack the casino right away?”

"okay. Arrest Kendell Isid and run through the casino like this.”

“Are you willing to respond to the arrest?”

“Would he have attacked us? We don’t know, but Johaim and Evelynn are nobles.”

" but."

“And if he surrenders easily, I'm not having any fun. You have to resist.”

Also, Zich's dirty personality was still there.

“Isid may not be the culprit.”

“It was then.”

He has a really cool personality.

“But did I really need to tell you the truth about the case?”

“Why, Gren Jennard?”

“There is no choice but to be reluctant.”

“Anyway, I had to talk to Johaim to get the right to investigate. Then it would be strange to leave the information only to Gren Gennard.”

“But I don’t know what he will do.”

“I was aiming for that.”

Lila blinked. Zich said with a refreshing smile.

“If he was aiming for the achievement of catching the criminal, he would have been quite embarrassed by now. I was the one who finally found the culprit. Probably, his achievements will inevitably go down. Then what is he going to aim for?”

“••• Arresting the criminal?”

"of course. But will that be the end of it?”

“•••You may vomit up other information. If it’s to promote your own achievements.”

Zich shrugged.

“We don’t know much about the culprit. There's a guy next to me who seems to know it well, isn't it weird not to use it?"

Only then did Lila learn all about Zich's plan and burst out laughing. and said

“After all, you are such a bad guy.”

"Hahaha! I will take it as a compliment.”

Zich's triumphant laughter echoed through the room.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 296 screen

The day after Zich identified Kendell Isid as the prime suspect at the meeting, Yohai Lim brought a piece of paper.

“It is a compulsory right to investigate.”

The documents he presented contained the mayor's seal, along with a sentence stating that he had given Joachim the authority to forcibly investigate the casino.

“I also got troops. We also got experienced investigators. Now all we have to do is research Kendell Isid and the casino.”

Zich looked at the troops and investigators Johaim had brought. Sleek armor and sharp spears glisten in the sunlight.

“It looks like they are quite elite, but the mayor must have had high expectations.”

“The investigation was not progressing as expected. In such a situation, Zich's information was of great help. Well, I'm still thinking about things you didn't tell us."

For whatever reason, Jo Haim still seems to have feelings for hiding information about Kendell Isid. However, such murmuring did not work for Zich.

“I don’t care what men think.”

“… It seems that Young-ae Rouge was similar to me.”

“Oh, this. It’s the same with women.”

“••• Do you usually say those words where you are?”

Evelynn, who had been out from the morning to see off Zich and the others, pointed at him.

“Originally, you have to do this where you are. Because if you do it behind the scenes, it's only a vile gossip."

“So you did it openly in front of me?”

“Actually, I don’t think it really matters. Whether the party is in front or not.”

“… The fact that I owe Mr. Zeek is just as grievous as I am now.”

If it were not for debt, it was an atmosphere of wanting to grab hold of the neck and shake it right away.

“Ha, really. You have to be tired until you see me off.”

“Isn’t that the charm of a man like me?”

"Yeah, shut up because you're loud."

In the end, Lyla, who was next to him, covered Zich's mouth. Evelynn, who watched the scene patheticly, said looking at Yohaim.

“Since there is a high possibility that Mr. Zeeg and his party will be swayed by Mr. Zee, we have no choice but to trust the Count.”

"Hahaha! Expectations are heavy. However, Zich-sama is only talking like that, and he will be serious when he goes into the investigation.”

Yoheim, who sided with Sieg like that, put on a solemn expression.

“And so am I.”

“Didn’t you say that you must succeed for your family and your estate?”

Since we've been meeting face to face in recent meetings, Evelynn got to know the circumstances of Yo Haim quite a bit. This was because it was so famous, and he had no intention of hiding it because he was cautioned that he had to take on the dark case of his family and territory.

"Yes. Resolving this won't go back to the way it used to be, but it will certainly be a big step toward restoring honor.”

At that time, the face of Joheim was the head of the family who carried the future of the family. While sacrificing himself, he felt a sense of responsibility for his family, his vassals, and the people of Yeongji.

'••• As expected, it is quite different from the author.'

Her ex-fiancée, an extreme egoist, who used her own family and family as well as her fiancée Evelynn solely to pursue her career, was almost the exact opposite.

Evelynn said with a soft smile.

“You will be fine  .”

"thank you."

Joachim answered with a smile.

“Are you done?”

Zich said, removing Lyla's hand. Joachim and Evelynn were startled and took one step back from each other.

“I understand that it creates a good atmosphere, but please refrain from doing this because you have an important task ahead of you.”

“Not like that! Besides, I don't want to hear that from Zich!"

“So is it.”

Zich, who spoke dryly at Yoheim's angry words, tapped him on the shoulder.

“Let’s go. You must restore the honor of your family and territory.”

Joachim sighed lightly.

“That was also when Condel Isid was really the culprit.”

Although he muttered a word like that, Johaim followed Zich's foot. And the troops sent by the city began to move.

Evelynn watched it silently.

* * *

The casino could be seen in Zich's eyes. The casino was in business as usual. Gambling addicts with haggard faces and blood in their eyes walk through the casino doors.

It's already the fourth time he's been to this place, so he's pretty familiar with the casino's appearance.

“Shall we go in?” Johaim nodded as Zich reached for the door. First of all, since the leader of this group was Joachim, Sieg was thoroughly asking for Joachim's opinion.

Joheim's permission was dropped. Zich put his hand on the big door of the casino and opened it with all his might.

The inside of the casino is revealed. I could feel the heat of the casino. But that was also for a while. People who noticed the door stop acting one by one. The large number of troops that did not appear to be moderate by anyone had doubts and some were terrified.

“Wow, what’s going on!”

A bodyguard, who had usually watched the casino with a daunting eye, ran to the scene. No matter how much he guarded the casino, he couldn't dazzle his eyes until in front of an armed mob with bladed spear-run spears.

Joachim stepped forward and offered the right to compulsorily investigate.

“I have come to investigate the casino with Kendel Isid, the owner of this casino. By the way, I've given the mayor's permission, so don't think about rebelling."

Seeing Yoheim's majestic voice and the compulsory investigation right with the stamps of the mayor and the miner clearly stamped on him, the bodyguard could not find anything to say. In the first place, it was a situation that could not be helped by his position or authority.

“Let me investigate.”

When Joheim finished speaking, the troops behind him rushed into the casino. The bodyguard said, 'Uh... !'I couldn't stop it, I just stuttered.

The guests are screaming and running around. Some soldiers led the guests outside. And the rest of the soldiers, following the command of the investigators, began to scour the casino.

“We’ll go too.”

said Joachim. Their target was Kendell Isid.

“I will guide you.”

Zich, who had been to Kendell's office before, took a step forward to guide him. That was then.

“I’m sorry, but we will act separately.”

The moment he heard the voice, Zich turned his head. His expression seemed to be puzzled, but his eyes were cold and he looked at the person who just spoke, Gren.

Gren, who had been a regular participant in the meeting, was also involved in the investigation. Not only Gren, but Lara's face as well. Gren had brought her to help.

“There are other people, including Mr. Zich, so I don’t think it’s necessary to go to meet the suspect myself. I think it would be better for me to investigate the casino with the other soldiers.”

As he said, there was no need to rush to meet one of the suspects. If there was no force in the party, I would not know, but Zich's force was sufficient. Isn't that proof that you defeated the shadow monsters that attacked them last time? In addition, if a battle breaks out, the troops scouring the casino will immediately provide support.

“I think so. I see. You check the casino.”

So Zich and Gren's group broke up before heading to Kendell's office.

Gren takes Lara and disappears into the casino. Zich looked at him quietly.

“Then we will go.”

As Joheim spoke, Zich began to guide again. Go up the stairs and pass the VIP floor and the VVIP floor. The people there were also paying close attention to whether they had noticed the commotion downstairs. However, they did not go astray like the people on the first floor, who had a certain level of belief, whether it was status or money . I just stared at Zich's group going up to Kendell's office with quiet eyes. Then some soldiers approached me and asked me to leave the casino, so I slowly moved and headed downstairs.

“I consider it.”

Zich pointed to the door. Kendell's office was tightly closed, as seen before.

“I will go in first.”

You had to be prepared for any contingency. Zich took out Windur and picked it up. Following Zich, the others also drew out their weapons. Joachim stepped back.

bang!

Zich opened the door vigorously. Fortunately, as soon as the door opened, there was no sign of sudden attack.

A wide open door lets in the interior scenery. Not much has changed from what we saw before. Not only the appearance of the room, but also the owner of the room. Kendell, who still looked menacing, was sitting at his desk, looking at Zich and the others.

“You have a guest.”

There was no doubt that he couldn't help but see the atrocities of those with swords, but Kendell's attitude was relaxed. No, I didn't even know that he was simply a person who didn't express his emotions well. he suddenly stood up.

“Perhaps the commotion downstairs is also the fault of the guests.”

Kendell glanced at the people and stopped looking at Zich and the others.

“There are people I’ve seen once before. Okay, what did you come here for?”

Joachim stepped forward. He showed the right to compulsorily investigate, and said it slowly and clearly.

"I'm here to arrest you, Kendel Isid."

“For what reason? I can't say that I lived without any shame, but I don't think I've ever committed a crime so great that an army of this size was inflicted.”

“You know there is a series of kidnappings going on in the city this time.”

"Yes. Even when they came to visit in the past, they also came for that reason.”

“You are the prime suspect.”

“••• Last time I heard that you were not the prime suspect.”

“Oh, that has changed.”

Jack intervened.

“Because there is evidence to doubt you.”

“That’s an interesting thing to say. Can I hear you from here?”

“Do you have a sister?” Even though it was his job, Kendell, who acted as if there was no red rice, stopped moving.

“It seems that he is dead now, but it seems that he loved him very much during his lifetime.”

“… That's right. It was because they were dependent on each other without parents since childhood. When I thought that I was able to live without worrying about money because I was successful, it was very sad that he died.”

Kendell's face drenched in sorrow. It wasn't that I shed a lot of tears. The emotion of sadness expressed was insignificant. But just that alone, I could instinctively feel how much he was mourning. Even the people who were wary of Kendell had feelings of sympathy for an instant.

Of course, Zeek was an exception.

“Didn’t that little brother look like this?”

Zich showed me a portrait of a shadow man. Kendell's eyebrows twitched. Before he could open his mouth, Zich nailed it first.

“It would be better not to think about denying it. It has already been confirmed by the priest who prayed for you when your brother died.”

“••.You are a meticulous person. I don't know where you got that portrait, but yes you are. It's obviously my sister who died a few years ago. But what's wrong with that?”

“We were attacked a while ago.”

“You’ve been through something sad. I am glad that there are no injuries.”

“Thank you for your concern. But then, one of the monsters that attacked us looked exactly like your sister.”

“That is strange. My sister obviously died a few years ago. You said that you also checked with the priest? But did my sister suddenly come to life and attack you?”

“It was not the humans who attacked us. Like I said, it was a monster.”

Candel frowned.

“Then you’re doing this just because the monster resembles my little sister?”

“There are a few more reasons, but that’s it.”

"i See. But, I know that all the monsters that attacked you were in human form, but have you not been able to find out the identities of the other monsters?”

Jack laughed.

“You’re pretty polite.”

“Isn't this a famous event? I did some research.”

Kendell also twisted the corners of his mouth.

“Didn’t you just pretend you didn’t know?”

“Because I might pretend to know and use a dumpster. I came from a back alley, so I had a lot of fun with my body.”

The two looked at each other for a moment.

Then Zich opened his mouth again.

“Sia Rubrenter. Where have you heard that name?”

Kendel's expression hardened.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 297 screen

It was very brief. Kendell's expression quickly returned to his original blunt and cold expression.

But there were people here who could capture that subtle moment.

“Well, I don’t know. Do you see where you live?”

Kendell snorted bluntly. However, Zich is not the only one who will let his prey show weakness. The weakness of prey is to cut, tear, and bite.

“I am the daughter of the Marquis of the Louvre Renter in the Cronon Kingdom of the neighboring country.”

"i See. But, why did you bring out his name?”

“Come on, let’s just listen.”

As if Zich told him not to rush, he stopped him with a sarcastic smile.

“Surprisingly, it is said that he made a loving escape with a servant of the family. I was really surprised to hear that. I only knew that stuff like that only came out in novels. What do you think about that, Mr. Yishid?”

“•••It's definitely not common.”

"Yes? What the hell was that servant really thinking? A different kind of love. It sounds sweet, but the reality is something else.”

Zich sighed like a parent lamenting a child who was ignorant.

“It’s a minor issue that each action conflicts with the different growing environments. Can someone who has lived a life of the upper class as a woman in a noble family suddenly adapt to life at the bottom? A person who has never lifted anything heavier than a teacup without literally putting a drop of water on his hand. As long as the person who ran away with you is a servant, you will never be able to lead a life like a nobleman. It would be nice if we didn’t fall into poverty.”

Zich spoke exaggeratedly, as if explaining the heroine of misery in a play.

“Is it true love to put someone you love in such a trash can? When you think of it that way, that servant is trash. Even comparing it to a rat crawling in the sewer, I think it's rather an insult to the rat kid."

"i See."

Kendell nodded his head politely. The change in his expression before was like a mirage, his face was expressionless. It's like hearing a swear word from a perfect third party you don't even know.

'•••No response?'

Lila tilted her head.

I thought that Zich's sudden accusation on the servant was meant to excite Kendall. So, I thought I was going to try to strengthen the guy's will.

However, Kundell's reaction was more than bland and dry. Is it possible to have complete control over your emotions? But when she saw Zich, Lila clicked her tongue. Because Zich is standing in front of her, you can't see all his expressions.

However, since he was standing diagonally, he could see a little of the side of his face.

'The corners of the mouth are up.'

I don't know what Zich is thinking, but at least it won't be good for Kendell.

“But if you think about it.”

Jack opened his mouth. Kendell sighed.

“Suddenly they came in and said something I didn’t know… .”

“The Sia Rubrenter is also a very funny person.”

Kendell shut his mouth.

“He is very immature.”

Suddenly, the words slandering Shia came out of Zich's mouth.

“The fact that he has eyes with the servants who work in his house is a person who doesn’t show the dignity of a nobleman at all.”

“Well, that’s what often happens to the immature young girls of noble families, but it seems that this woman was not satisfied with that. Did you not run away in love with a servant?”

Still, Zich had a smile on his face and his voice was kind. But the language the voice conveyed was poignant, and his eyes were sharply fixed on Kendell.

“It's really outrageous. What were you thinking? What, did he even think of himself as the main character in the novel? What kind of treatment the Marquis of Rubrent was treated by those around him, it's obvious even if you don't look at it. He cherishes the grace of his parents who gave birth to him and raised him, and the honor of his family.

Would you have thought that you would be able to live a happy life by throwing it into a cooking gutter?”

posture is sloppy. The chin is raised, the legs crossed, and the arms are trembling.

“Did I ever think, 'I'm getting freedom for true love!' If he's in front of you, I'd like to ask you to slow down."

“••• Still, didn’t I say that she was a young girl of an aristocratic family? Your words seem a bit dangerous. As far as I know, you are not even a nobleman.”

At Kendall's words, Zich smirked.

“You must have done a very detailed investigation. You know who I am.”

“Did I tell you before? I did it because I didn't want to use a dumpster for nothing. Because I’m from the back alley.”

“I’m from the back alley… .”

The tone of doubt is blatant. But Zich didn't dig deep into it.

“Thank you for your concern, but it’s okay. I am also from a noble family. The house came out. And didn't the Shia Lub rental young girl also run out of the house on her own? Then it's commonplace. I don't think it's going to be anything special."

Zich shrugged. Then he smiled and added a word.

“And I don’t think what I said here will ever leak out.”

Hearing that, Johaim nodded inwardly.

'He said to put the other soldiers outside the door for that.'

At Zich's advice that there is no need to rush in to arrest one person, all the soldiers who supported him from the city were waiting outside the room.

The only ones here are Joachim and Sieg and the others. Even if Zich's words become a problem, they are all people who will take his side.

'Really thorough.'

Even while Joachim was admiring, he continued to speak.

“How would you describe her? A girl buried in a dream? Are you an idiot who can't understand reality? Or is he a paranoid who really knows fiction?”

Zich took a step forward.

“No, such euphemisms are out of the question. Then it's as if I'm trying to protect her. I don't think so. Why am I… .”

take one more step

“Are you supposed to be misunderstood that you are on the side of that stupid, ignorant, mace-like woman who doesn’t understand reality? I can't. Cancer, don't. If you think about it, it’s cheaper even if the woman with the goal is more slandered than the servant.”

one more step Even as Zich drew closer to him, Kendel did not move. I looked into Zich's eyes clearly.

“Isid-san also thinks so, don’t you? The woman must have died long ago. It's okay to bet. It's miserable when I think of the old house where I couldn't eat, couldn't wear, and rolled around in the mud. Maybe that's what he was thinking right before he died?"

Zich stopped in front of the desk. He looked directly into Kendall's eyes and said.

“Oh, I was foolishly dreaming in vain. I miss the warm embrace of the house. I want to eat the delicious food of the past. And you will think so.”

Jack laughed. very bright

“I didn’t believe in a servant like this and follow me.”

Quad Duck!

There was the sound of something breaking.

Hans immediately stopped in front of the group. Snock girded the mithril, and Lyla and Elena raised their staffs. Yo-Ha-Im also prepared to cut his wrist right away in case of an emergency.

But nothing happened.

Zich only lowered his eyes slightly. I looked at Kendall's hand.

His fingers were half clenched and digging into the desk. He could see pieces of broken wood sticking out between his fingers.

Zich turned his gaze back to Kendell. Kendell's face still looked expressionless.

“Hey, you’re stronger than you look, Mr. Isid. The desk looks very expensive, but it was a waste.”

“Then why are you excited? Have you ever been filled with sorrow as you imagine the end of Miss Rubrenter? Ah, you don't have to.”

Zich waved his hand.

“Such a garbage woman, pity

It's not worth it, is it? A broken desk is a waste.”

Kendell was speechless. However, his fingers were just a little more digging into the desk.

Seeing this, Zich watched with delight. Lila, who grasped his feelings by the side face that was showing little by little, shook her head.

'You really have a dirty personality.'

Lyla knew for sure what Zich was doing.

it's a simple gag

I wonder if it would be okay to explain it with the expression ‘grumpy’, but it is clear that it is an extension of that.

'They attacked Joachim Dracul and Evelynn Rouge, and they grinded their teeth.'

If their suspicions are correct, Kendell Isid is the servant who escaped in love with Sia Rubrenter.

And he must have loved her so much that he made the target of the attack his lover as an apology for losing his lover.

But what if insults are poured out against his beloved lover in front of him.

'It has an effect. Effect' Kendell was clearly unable to stand the humiliation of Sia Lubrenter, who should have been the perfect stranger. With that, his doubts were almost turned into certainty.

'But I don't think most people can do that.'

What's even more surprising to Lyla is that, perhaps, the current situation is only the beginning of Zich's grudge.

“You seem a little more angry with this.”

Zich gently placed his hand on Kendell's hand digging into the desk.

“I can’t. If you are so excited.” It's a voice like that, even if it's a smirk, someone who doesn't care about it, seems to have a savage intent the moment he hears it.

“I must have been patient. If I show my power here and get excited like this, is it nothing more than saying, 'I am the culprit'?”

A breath-taking laughter hits Kendell's eardrums.

“Come on, be patient. We don't have any great evidence either. As you said, it's just that your dead sister and the monster look alike. It could be a coincidence enough. Haven't you been confirmed as the culprit yet? If you're still holding on here, the plan isn't complete. You can’t be caught already.”

People were surprised. I wish I could say something like that to the suspect.

Yoheim, who had been observing Zich's behavior until now, was about to say something. But Lyla stopped him.

'At a time like this, you should let the stress go away.'

The promise that Zich had promised to help him if he didn't follow the path of the Demon King was valid.

'And Zich won't miss his prey.'

It was already a prediction close to certainty.

“We can't keep you in custody for long without clear evidence found here in the casino. And you've already made at least four episodes with money here and there, haven't you? I can't get you acquitted, but at least to the extent that I can torture you in the absence of evidence or use your strength to keep you from being held for long. I also know the tricks of people like you.”

Zich removed his hand from the back of Kendell's hand.

“So hold on. No matter how much I curse, slander, and trample on Sia Rubrenter, you must never be angry. After all, you are someone who has nothing to do with her. Is it suspicious if you get more aroused than necessary by the swearing of an unrelated person?”

Zich touched the corner of his mouth with his two index fingers. And pushed it up. The corner of Zich's mouth was like a funny clown, and he drew an awkward arc.

“So laugh. not to be suspicious. Right Now."

(Continued on next page)

# No. 298 screen

Kendell didn't laugh at Zich's words. Still, the emotion itself disappeared from the blunt face. Zich was aware of that condition. Being so angry, angry, and angry, rather than being emotional, becomes insensitive.

"•••great."

Kendell spoke up. A voice without emotion seems to seep into a dark cave.

“You seem very suspicious of me, so there is nothing I can do about it. What can I do against you guys who have brought so many armed forces with you? I will follow you.”

Up to that point, it is the figure of a suspect who meekly cooperates with the investigation. However, the words that followed hit people's ears with a chill in them.

“But if you can't uncover my crime, I'm probably in a pretty troublesome situation. Because I didn't grow up well enough to endure such insults."

“It is an insult. I have only ever cursed a servant who escaped from love and a former noble girl. If Mr. Isid is not the party, there is no need to feel angry.”

The blatant sarcastic sarcasm had disappeared somewhere, and Zich returned to his manners as before. But the thorns did not disappear from the horse.

“Your attitude was disrespectful enough, even to an outright third party. That’s why I got a fever.”

“Oh, is it? I am really sorry about this.”

Contrary to his words, of course, Zich did not show an apologetic expression at all.

“There is no need for an apology. I will take care of the proper compensation.”

“Hey, are you threatening me now?”

Isid pressed his face into Zich's face.

“Don’t be cocky.”

His three hundred eyes gleam, and the scars on his face wiggle like raging waves. The face alone was enough to intimidate any human being.

“The Count behind you can’t do anything because of the difference in status, but I can bury enough of you, who doesn’t even know where you’re going to eat. Even if you really come from a noble family, you can no longer call yourself a nobleman as long as you run away from home.”

“Like Sia Rubrenter?”

Unlike before, Kendell's face had not changed. He must have been poisoned. he spoke coldly.

“It would be better to hope that I don’t come out safely this time.”

“You threatened me in front of me. It’s pretty straightforward.”

Joachim said displeased. It was like he was a nobleman, and he had the status of a count. Any commoner would have knelt down on the floor and begged for forgiveness.

But Kendel was different.

"well. It's not that I have a big liver, but the Count's prestige isn't that great, is it?"

Joachim's eyes twitched.

“The Dracule family is already famous in the kingdom. If this case is not resolved, there is a high possibility that the friendship with the lord here will not continue. Isn't it? What's more, it will be even more so when the news that an innocent person has been arrested while insulting him is even more so.”

“What do you want to say?”

“I am just concerned. The future of Dracul's estate. I also don’t want to see a noble family in the kingdom collapse in vain.”

“That’s what I do.”

“Of course you would. It’s just a futile worry.” Kendell pushed the chair and walked slowly to the side of the desk.

“You said you were arresting me? Then let me follow you. It's clear that the Count now has the right to compulsorily investigate. I hope you find something meaningful in this casino.”

Kendell looked at the people coldly. and said

“If you don't, you're going to be in a lot of trouble. I bet.”

“Hey, you are so confident.”

Conversely, to Kendell, who was threatening the Count and Zeeg's party, Zich answered in a cheerful tone.

“It’s like they think we won’t find anything in this casino.”

“Honestly, yes. I am not the culprit.”

"okay?"

At the confident answer without any doubts, everyone except for Zich became a little anxious. Bringing so many troops and looking for evidence should show some basic anxiety, but Kendell doesn't seem to care about that at all.

Of course, this is not to suggest that Kendall is not the culprit now. I have faith in Sieg, and the passionate reaction he showed when the sale of Sia Lubrent was announced earlier also convinced me that he was the culprit.

However, the evidence is a different story altogether.

said Jack.

“If you see that kind of reaction, there are two things I can think of. Either there really isn't any evidence to prove you're the culprit here, or I'm sure we'll never find it."

“It is the former. Again, I am not the culprit.”

"You mean you're not the ex-servant of the Louvrenter, who ran away in love with that stupid, goofy woman?"

"That's right."

She called Sia Rubrenter a rough expression of a stupid, hollow woman, but this time, Kendell's expression did not change. I glanced down at his hand, but there was no such obvious scene as he couldn't hold back his anger and clenched his fists until his hands bleed.

“Then I’m glad.” Jack laughed. However, Kandell felt nothing but comfort, rather than a sense of dread, seeing Zich's smile now.

“No, to be honest, I was stabbed in the conscience even though I was swearing earlier.”

The eyes of Zich's party in the back, including Lyla and Yoheim, were all focused on the back of Zich's head. Even Elena, who had just joined the party, did the same. No matter how tolerant of Zich's actions, even those who had given up halfway, they could not tolerate the terrible sound of Zich's conscience.

But Zich was calm. I don't know if he noticed the group's gaze or not, but they were sure that even if he did, he wouldn't mind at all.

“If you were that servant, you would be disappointed. He loved the Viscount Young-ae of Rubrent so much that he escaped from love, but kept his mouth shut at the story of cursing his lover in front of his eyes. It's not love.”

Zich walked over to Kendell and put his arm around his shoulder.

“Even though they cursed like that, I wanted to believe that their love was real. Since you're not the culprit, at least you don't have to deny their love now. Yes. If you were a servant, that love would be more waste than foul-smelling garbage, and savage than the mating of promiscuous beasts, but not so.”

“•••Are you finished with what you have to say? If that's the case, you'll be arrested soon."

“Why are you in such a hurry? After all, casino management will be impossible for the time being, so can we talk slowly and share more?”

“I have nothing to say to you, who is so rude. You'd be better off going to jail." Kendell looked at Joachim.

“Isn't the Count in charge here? Wouldn't it be better to finish your mission quickly?"

“Zeek-nim, just do it.”

When Joachim spoke, Zich also took his hand off Kendell's shoulder and quietly retreated.

Joachim summoned the soldiers. They tied the candell with a special rope and folded their arms at each side. Just transfer it like this.

Lyla came over to Zich.

“This time, you really did a good job.”

“Did it look like that?”

“I heard Hans and Snock look a little tired too?”

"okay? Those guys, I thought they were well educated, but they're still naive. I haven’t even started properly yet.”

As expected, Zich didn't seem to want to let Kendall go through this kind of bullying.

“But are you sure you are confident that you will find the evidence? Seeing you follow me like that, it seems like it was really well hidden.”

"Sure."

Lila put it down for an hour.

'It seems that there is really a way.'

“What evidence? Where are you hiding?”

Lyla asked lightly. However, Zich's reply was shocking.

"I do not know."

"•••what?"

Lyla rolled her eyes.

“You say you are confident that you will find evidence.”

" right."

“But you don’t know what kind of evidence or how it’s hidden?”

''o”
-o'.

An absurd answer comes back too lightly. But I was surprised for a while. Soon she narrowed her eyes and looked at Zich.

“What are you up to? Blow quickly.”

With the tip of the stick, press firmly on Zich's myeongchi. Really missing specs.

nothing to hide Jack replied.

“If it’s something you don’t know, you can leave it to someone you know.”

“… Anyone know the evidence Kendell Isid hid?”

There was a figure floating right in Lyla's head.

'Gren Jennard!'

Come to think of it, when Gren entered the casino, he said he would search the casino with the soldiers and left them.

“Besides, the effect is even better if he is a bastard who is dedicated to making achievements.”

The stairs outside the office became noisy. A soldier rushed up the stairs in a hurry.

“The Count!”

“What’s going on?”

Joachim met the soldier.

“I found a strange passage in the casino! It looks like a secret passage, but it seems that something quite deep is connected somewhere!”

People's eyes naturally turned to Kendell. He had a hard face. He was a person with no change in expression, so he looked closely to see if he was just having a normal face, but it wasn't.

He was clearly astonished.

“Oh, what an amazing find!”

Zich went all the way to the soldier, trembling with fuss.

“A secret passage found in an ordinary casino. It is a very interesting entity. Oh, of course, this is not proof that Mr. Isid is the culprit.”

Zich says he is happy.

"sure! There's no way Mr. Isid could be the culprit! If that is the case, Mr. Ishid will become a piece of garbage that tramples on his own love and blasphemes against the feeling of love, which is unclean even for his lover! I believe! Ishid is not that kind of person! But that doesn't mean we can't just let the suspicious passageways go unnoticed.”

Zich stood in front of Kendell exaggeratedly. Then he saw Joachim and said.

“Give the order, Count! Investigate that passage right now.”

And he looks at Kendall. He raised his chin and raised one corner of his mouth, then looked down as if smirking. Even if he didn't like that figure, it automatically entered Kundell's view.

Kendell's face contorted like a demon.

Whoo!

Suddenly, something black jumped out from behind Kendell. Zich, who was already preparing, swung Windur.

Aww!

A shadow in the form of a large sword was blocked by the Windur of Zeeg.

“It’s an attack!”

“Protect the Count!”

“Arrest him!”

The soldiers are startled and grab their weapons. Zich and his party immediately raised their weapons towards Kendell.

“You have finally revealed your identity.”

Zich licked his lips. He glanced at the black shadow protruding from Kendell's feet, and then met Kendall's gaze.

“I am asking this because I am really curious. How did it feel to have to leave a human being insulting your lover right in front of you? How does it feel to be completely denied self-love? You usually can't stand it, do you? Even between those who love enough to run away from love. Ah, thinking like that raises new questions.”

Jack said with a smirk.

“Did she really love you?”

pudding!

Kendell grinded his teeth.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 299 Tuesday

Scratch!

The rising shadow cut the cord that bound Kendall. It was something that restrained his magical power, but it seemed that it was not enough to handle Kundell's power.

Kendell raised his arm. A shadow climbed up the body and wrapped around his arm. waved his arms

quaang

Windur blocks Kendell's attack.

It was a pretty heavy attack.

Hans and Snock attacked Kendell. Estelaide radiated light and a sharp mithril fell down like a meteorite.

Quang! Quang!

Something sprung from Kendell's feet, blocking his attack path. it was a shadow

A few more pop out. Those who knew its strength were tense.

Joachim steps back and gives orders to the soldiers. Conversely, Zich, Hans, and Snock took it one step further. Lyla and Elena supplied magical power to the staff.

The protruding shadow wriggled its characteristic amorphous body and attacked people.

Sieg, Hans, and Snock kept them in check so that they would not be directed at ordinary soldiers.

The shadow appeared again. Considering the previous raid, it's definitely going to be a pretty tough fight. However, it was not for nothing that he brought a large number of reinforcements.

“The Count!”

“I’m here to help!”

“Oh, welcome!”

Among the troops, the elite knights who were chosen by the city arrived. Johai Im welcomed them.

“Condell Isid was the culprit! Please help Ziek-sama and arrest them right now!”

"all right!"

The knights drew their swords. A large amount of magical power fluttered from the sword. As the knights were truly informed, Zich began to gain the upper hand.

But Zich wasn't even vigilant.

'The shadow he can cast would not be this much.'

Considering only the shadows that escaped in the past, the number of shadows should be greater than now. Above all, Kendell wasn't creating shadow humans.

'You don't seem to have a lot of spare time, is there any reason why you can't pour out all your energy?'

If that's the case, I'd be grateful for Zich. Sieg never had the stupid idea of ​​defeating an opponent with all his might.

As the knights intervened, Kendell frowned. He stares at the Zich attacking him as if to kill him.

Zich also looked at him. When someone with a very bright, grudge sees them, they burst into anger and smile so good that they don't know what to do.

“Where is Mr. Jennard!”

Joachim shouted, and a soldier answered.

“You came in to investigate what is in the secret passage you found!”

Kendell responded. Still, his grim expression became even more contorted like a demon.

'There must be something in the secret passage.'

The shadows that had spread throughout the battle suddenly retreated. One of them threw himself to the floor.

quaang

There was a big hole in the floor.

'Are you trying to run away?'

Zich hurriedly swung his Windur. But the shadow cut in front of Zich.

“Hey, you have to answer my question! Because you really loved her!”

Kendell's bloody eyes turned to Zich again. But he didn't fall for any further provocations.

He disappeared downstairs. The shadows still attacked Zich and the others.

“Lyla!”

"Huh!"

When Zich gives the signal, Hans and Snock pull back. Zich also stepped back. The knights also retreated at Joheim's orders, seeing Zich's signal.

Lyla's staff radiated enormous magical power.

Lyla memorizes the last chants. The shadows came over. But the end of her chants was faster.

Whoo!

The surrounding air vibrated. The air swirled around the shadows. The accelerated air turns into a strong wind and blows.

Each layer of air rotating in different directions was sufficient to tear everything in its sphere of influence.

However, there was no effect outside the scope of influence. I couldn't feel the breeze, let alone a strong wind, to shake my hair. no wind noise But how the shadows were torn was clearly visible. Cut, torn, and torn.

Without the sound of wind or destruction, only that visual information calmly conveyed the horror.

After the silent destruction was over, the shadows disappeared completely.

"•••awesome."

Elena muttered. Indeed, Lyla's magic was to make you wonder the more you look at it.

However, Lila, who had literally swept away the shadows, took care of the wand as if it was nothing special.

“Let’s go too.”

She tapped Elena on the shoulder and headed downstairs.

Zich, Hans, and Snock had already been following Kendell using the stairs.

"Yes Yes!"

Elena hurriedly followed Lyla. Joachim also gave orders and moved his forces to pursue Kendell.

The knights and soldiers hurried down the stairs. Still, he glanced at Laila. He marveled at the magic that destroyed those strong shadows at once.

It wasn't that hard to follow Kendall. It was enough to find the most noisy place among the buildings.

Injured soldiers and corpses could be seen here and there as if they were trying to stop Kendell.

Leila and Elena, who ran past them, were soon able to reach the basement of the casino.

There was a fairly large hole in the basement of the casino. The stairs are steadily going up to make it easy to go down.

“I think this is a secret passage.”

"Yes Yes… .”

Elena's answer is not cool. It was because of the devastation that unfolded near the hole.

A significant number of troops were dead or wounded. She was still not used to this kind of battle.

Lila lifted her body slightly. She looked at Elena. Her expression was still pale.

“Will you stay?”

say to her Elena looked around again. I swallowed my saliva, closed my eyes once, and clenched my fists.

“Let’s go!”

"okay."

Lila smiled slightly and lifted Elena's body. The two of them disappeared into the entrance.

* * *

Zich was running down the aisle with Hans and Snock. I could see Kendell's back running away.

His pace was quite fast. It was about the same speed as Zich was chasing.

'Hans and Snock can't keep up.' In fact, the distance between the two was gradually widening. However, he couldn't slow down to keep pace with the two of them.

'If you miss his appearance, it will be impossible to track him in that state.'

Kendell's shadows have completely sealed Zich's detection ability so far.

Kendell himself had a very faint trace of Zich's sense of whether he could use that ability. If you go a little further, it will disappear from your senses like shadows.

'Well, it's a straight passage, so don't get lost

I'm not sure.'

Zich kept his pace, telling the two to follow him as quickly as possible.

Whoops! Whoops!

Two shadows emerged from Kendell's feet. Zich clicked his tongue.

'This must be a headache.'

I couldn't give him any more distance. Zich tightened his grip on Windur.

The distance between Zich and the shadow decreased in an instant.

The shadow that got closer stretched his body. One sharpened his body to pierce Jik, and the other stretched his body wide and tried to crush it.

Zich swung Windur with all his might.

Scratch!

The body of the shadow that had spread out was cut in half cleanly. However, as he swung his sword so strongly, Zich's body became defenseless. As it was, the shadow pierced through Zich's body.

Whoops! Whoops! Whoops!

There was a terrifying sound, and blood spurted from Zich's body. A three-pronged shadow awl pierced through Zich's body.

But Zich didn't make a single moan. I only dreamed of the corners of my eyes once.

perok

Zich plunged Windur into the shadows. And injected a lot of magic power.

pooong

A shadow burst from the explosion of magic.

As the shadow disappeared, blood gushed from the wound. It is an attack that is fatal to anyone looking at it.

But Zich didn't care and kept running. Then he took out the potion.

A really important part, like the heart, is in a state that prevents you from getting injured by twisting your body. Zich drank the potion and sprayed it on the wound.

The wound healed like a lie.

How to tell someone you've gone crazy. However, thanks to that, the distance from Kendell decreased. He was able to sense the presence of the guy with certainty.

I could see Kundell looking towards him. probably went for it Zich exclaimed loudly.

“Who are you going to? Are you going to offer flowers to your lost lover? You can go there to pay tribute, to cry, and to run and rejoice, but I have to answer my questions and go! Did you really love Sia Rubrenter!”

Suck; Suck; Whoops! Whoops!

There are four shadows this time. It seems that Zich's provocation paid off. They crawl to the ground.

'It's a little difficult to kill four dogs at once.'

But Zich didn't slow down. Before it collided with the shadow, he swung it with magic power into Windur.

woohoo!

A huge air filled with magical power struck the shadows like a hammer.

The shadows stopped. But it doesn't look like it's been hit hard. But what Zich wanted was that brief break.

fault!

Zich rolled his feet. I jumped up to the ceiling of the passage as it was and jumped down the ceiling once again behind the spur shadows.

The shadows attacked Zich hastily. However, Zich avoids them with his fantastic movements and starts chasing Kendell again. The shadows ran towards Zich, but their distance gradually increased.

'Hans and Snock will take care of it.'

And soon Lyla and Elena will come too.

But it seemed that Kendell was determined to finally separate Zich. Once again, the shadows wriggle under Kendell's feet. It was time to think about how to deal with those guys.

Something caught Zich's senses.

'This.'

A certain presence was felt in front of Kendel. was like a person

'Are they reinforcements for Kendell Isid?'

He thought about it for a moment, but Zich immediately remembered the person who had entered this underground passage before Kendel.

'Gren Jennard!'

Did you catch up with him? Or was he hiding to catch Kendall?

'By the way, I don't think this is Glenn Gennard's legacy?'

Kendell, who was ahead of him, also felt the presence of him, so he put the shadow he was trying to take out again. And it slowed down a bit. It is clearly demarcated.

I saw someone blocking Kendell's way.

A woman with long red hair.

'Lara Browning?'

Come to think of it, it's not unusual for her to be there. Because she got along very well with Gren Jennerd.

The strange thing was that she was alone. No matter how he looked, Gren Jennard was nowhere to be seen. I didn't even feel a sign.

I could see her yelling at Kendall. It was said to stop.

But Kendell couldn't hear it. He pulled out the shadows to clear the obstacles in his way.

'Are you your opponent?'

As far as Zich knows, Lara Browning's skills aren't that strong right now. It cannot even be compared with his ability to block his way like a huge fortress before returning.

I didn't think she would be able to stop Kendall like that.

quaang

“Ugh!”

As expected, she was seen groaning at the siege of the shadows.

'Let's try to save it.'

She may also be a pitiful victim by Gren. Zich jumped into battle.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 300 screen

Lara Browning's sword gradually lost its power as the shadows surrounded it from all directions. Kendell watched it.

'Is this woman alone?'

This passage leads to his very important base. That is why he moved immediately when this passage was discovered. The only intruders I've seen so far are the one who's following him now, chewing on the raw flesh hundreds of times, spitting it out, and trampling it down with his feet again, but his anger will not go away and the woman in front of him.

If this woman was the only one who did the right thing, there would be no possibility that his base had been invaded.

But I didn't have time to find out.

Once, Zich kept running. His skills are by no means overwhelming. It is impossible to avoid the battle of interrogating Lara here for nothing. Besides, I'm sure a lot of volunteers will come running after me.

Kendell ran down the aisle again.

'I'm going.'

Jack was disappointed. I wanted to concentrate on the battle with Lara as it is and get her feet tied up, but it seems like she didn't pay attention to Lara to that extent.

Surrounded by the shadows, Lara was seen swinging her sword in all directions. A clear light of magical power could be seen in the sword.

'You're definitely talented.'

He was a member of the party of heroes who killed Zich before returning, so his talent is certain. In addition, the visible talent is quite high.

'But it hasn't bloomed yet.'

The shadows that are now clinging to it, let alone Demon King Siegmore, seem to be struggling. Zich attacked a shadow.

Koo!

Even while attacking Lara, it noticed Zich's movement and transformed his amorphous body to block Zich's attack. But that is already expected. Zich swung his sword once more. And once again. one more time.

In the end, the defense of the shadow was breached by an attack like Nodo.

Scratch!

The shadow cut and disappeared. There was some space in the gap. Zich slipped through the gap.

woohoo!

The attack on Lara was blocked.

“All, you… !”

Lara looks at Zich in surprise. But Zich was not looking at Lara. He didn't even want to ask any questions about why he was alone or where Gren was.

He was only interested in Kundell's presence.

'I think I'll miss it soon.'

After Kendell looked at Lara and hesitated for a moment, the distance narrowed a little, but that didn't make it much narrower. At least if you help Lara get rid of all the shadows here, you'll miss him.

'You don't have to do that.'

The only thing that is important to Zich right now is to fuck Kendell.

But I didn't mean to just throw her away.

“Suck!”

take a deep breath rushed to the shadows.

“Come on, wait a minute!”

Lara shouted from behind, but Zich ignored it. went straight into battle. Windur, engulfed with magical power, was swept around in an enormous amount. The defense drives the shadows with a strong attack that almost gives up. Of course, the defense was neglected that much, and the shadows' attacks caused several wounds. However, Zich's attack did not subside.

Kwajik!

A single shadow fell on two sides from above.

Whoops!

Another was pierced through the body by Windur and exploded with magical power.

Quad Duck!

The other was literally crushed by Zich's magic.

But the price was high. Blood was running down his body.

"Hey! are you okay Hey, first of all, I have a potion... !”

“Listen well.”

Ignoring Lara's concerns, Zich told her.

“Now that I have killed three of them, I should have had a bit more leeway. Of course, there are four more guys coming in the back, so we don't have much time to go.”

As Zich said, the shadow he had been avoiding was running hard. If they join, the battle will be more difficult. Lara's expression hardened.

But Lara did not despair.

“It’s okay, it’s okay! If you and I work together... !”

“So hold on. If your skills are good, you might be able to hold out for a little bit.”

“… Yes?"

Lara asked stupidly, but Zich didn't want to talk to her anymore. It ran through the siege of the shadows as it was. He drank a bottle of potion and forgot to heal his wounds.

"•••what?"

The situation passed like a storm and Lara was dumbfounded. However, because of the shadows that soon attacked again, I had no choice but to move my body.

“Come on, wait… !”

There was no way the shadows would stop attacking by saying such a thing. Lara hurriedly swung her sword. Another fierce battle ensued. But her despair did not go away.

But that was also for a while. The shadow that was chasing Zich began to attack Lara in earnest. With the addition of four shadows, the number she faces increased by one more than before. Her sword becomes dizzy and the wounds on her body begin to increase.

'uh? I guess I'm going to die here?'

I don't feel it It's like dreaming. However, the attack of the approaching shadows was real, and the pain felt from the wound was real.

Of course, he was always ready to die after following Gren. However, I thought that death was also to be by Gren's side or to protect Gren, but I never thought of dying in an unknown underground passage like this.

filled with fear I'm short of breath and my muscles are racing wildly. The battle continued with the training and experience she had accumulated so far, but the trajectory of her flowing sword continued to waver.

I clenched my teeth and tried to calm myself down. However, the clear superiority of power cannot be overturned just by being a little straight.

The moment when the sense of crisis that you could really die like this is heightened!

light was seen

not an analogy It was truly a dazzling light. The light shining brightly in the darkness of the underground passage drives away the dark shadows in front of them.

The urgency that felt like a shadow had been locked in my neck disappeared at any moment, and I felt a little more relaxed. And that leeway grew even greater when the surrounding land rose and pushed the shadows away.

chin!

He sees someone standing in front of him. Lara looked at him.

The figure with the dazzlingly bright sword was someone she knew.

"Are you okay?"

He was Hans.

* * *

'Is it time to be rescued?'

Zich glanced back.

'If he were alive, he would have met Hans and Snock.' It wasn't that Zich left Lara carelessly. Since then, I've been trying to save her properly.

Predicting her skills, he reduced the number of shadows to at least enough to survive until the arrival of Hans and Snock, who followed him.

'It'll be close, though.'

But if you delay any longer, you will miss the condell.

'Well, I did my best. If you can't stand it, that's his fate.'

Kendell didn't appear to want to let Zich go any further. It doesn't send shadows and shows no signs of doing anything else in the way. It was just running.

'Are you running out of shadows to use?'

Either way, it's not a bad situation for Zich.

The bizarre leaping between the two of them continued to some extent.

Did you arrive at your destination? Kundell's speed began to slow down. Then his movements stopped completely. Sieg also stopped at a certain distance from Kendall.

Both eyes turned to the same place.

Gren Gennard. he was there

“I was waiting.”

Gren opened his mouth. The calm voice really puts the listener's heart at ease.

Kendell looked at Gren and then looked behind him.

“•••Did you go in?”

There was a door behind Gren. A fairly large iron gate. Considering the size, the thickness is probably considerable.

But it wouldn't have been an obstacle for Gren. In fact, the iron gate was greatly crushed. Although it is closed once, it will no longer play the role of blocking access from the outside.

"Yes."

"okay."

Kendell's voice lowered. Even an ignorant person would know that he is very hot right now.

Gren sighed. Whoever sees it, it's loud as if  it's hello .

“Don't worry. I didn't touch anything inside."

"•••what?"

Condel was surprised, as if it was unexpected.

“You can go in and check it out.”

“What’s your plan?”

Kendell said threateningly.

“There is no gossip. They just thought it was pointless to ruin the things inside.”

Kendell looked at Gren quietly. It was clear that he had no idea what he was saying.

“Actually, I know some of your abilities.”

u  ।  n

Condell was surprised.

"That's why I found your secret passage. Your ability to stealth with your shadows is definitely great. So, you must have been very confident even in the circumstances of being arrested. There won't be any significant evidence. But it was fairly easy for me, knowing your abilities, to find a way.”

“… Lies are... I don’t think so.”

"sure. And I think I know your purpose.”

Gren said in a confident voice.

“I bet. No matter how hard you try, Sia Rubrenter will never come back alive.”

“in”

Kendall's movements stiffened. It felt like Jung Gok was stabbed, or a hidden secret was revealed. But one thing was clear: Gren's words weren't very pleasing to Kendell.

“Your power is the power to manipulate shadows. And the shadow must be what kills a man and pulls it out of his corpse.”

Gren's words echo through the cave. Kendell stared at him as if to kill him, and Zich watched them quietly.

“I know you can pull out quite a few shadows from a single corpse. And if you combine the shadows drawn from the same corpse, you become the shadow man you saw in the previous raid, and you can wield quite a powerful force. But the person who was alive never comes to life.”

“•••I said something.”

Kendell laughed bitterly. However, there was a little bit of relief behind the smile.

“I already know that. Stop talking nonsense and get out of that door. If you really leave the facilities inside, as you said, I won't kill you."

But Gren didn't move.

“Add another shadow to the shadow of the subject you want to revive.”

Kendell's expression hardened again.

“The additional shadows are only part of the shadows that come out of the corpse. If you add a lot of shadows from one corpse, the purity of the shadows you want to save will be polluted, so you should never do it. By attaching and pasting a part of the shadow of a corpse like that, the shadow man becomes much stronger than the other shadow men. Yes, like the shadow of the Sia Louvrenter you made. If the shadow that has become so strong is put into the body of the creator, the dead will be resurrected. How do you feel, the information you have is correct?”

Kendell didn't answer. Gren looks at him pitifully.

“I’ll say it again.”

"•••Shut up."

“The plan to save your Sia Rubrenter… .”

“I told you to shut up.”

“It’s all in vain.”

“Shut up!”

Kendell ran to Gren. His shadow and tornium collide violently with each other.

All of this, Zich watched silently.

And I thought.

'Crazy things. They've been doing a show amongst themselves.'

(Continued on next page)





The 3 () 1 Chemistry

The reason why Zich was quietly waiting even after catching up with Kendell was to see how Gren came out.

Now, Sieg is convinced that Gren is almost a hypocrite and has regressed like himself. Fortress was even thinking that he might have had more rounds.

But he never let go of the suspicion that he was wrong.

So he had to keep checking what Gren was doing. Moreover, it is true that Kundell's abilities are not well known.

In many ways, Zich tried to find out information from the conversation in front of him.

However, he didn't know that a situation like that of a low-quality third-class novel would happen right before his eyes.

'No, you could have predicted it enough.'

After returning, he forgot for a while because he didn't get along well with Gren, but when he defeated himself, he said that he would recite evil deeds.

He's a guy who deserves to do something like 'the main character who tells the truth to a villain who goes the wrong way'.

'Huh? A villain going the wrong way?'

Zich looked at the situation in front of him from the position of a half-watching audience now. An enraged Kendell is attacking Gren. Gren swung his tornium to block the shadows. However, it was difficult for him to withstand the shadows he was determined to push. The shadows that already surround him are turning 30 .

But Gren didn't care. With a sad expression on her face, she desperately appealed to him.

“If you don’t believe it, try it right now! Sia Rubrenter must have opened his eyes! But that's not the lover you know!”

“Shut up!”

“God damn it!”

Gren snorted. After deflecting some shadows, I slammed the iron door open. And pointed to the inside of the room with the tornium.

“Then let’s do that dog-like experiment right now!”

Gren, who had been persuading him with his polite tone, spat out abusive language. Kendell faltered at the force. Even the shadows didn't rush towards Gren, who had become a castle full of gaps by pointing to the inside of the room.

“Your efforts are in vain! Your lover will not survive!”

“Such a lie… !”

“Then there was really no doubt about that nonsense!”

Kendell didn't answer. he's also mine

I had a question like that

It's just a way to resurrect the dead. And I only saw such a method in fairy tales when I was young.

But he had to do it this way. Because that was the only way to get his lover back, whom he had lost earlier.

Of course, at most, it could be an exaggerated reaction to a few words of the enemy. If someone else had said something like this, Kendall wouldn't have reacted like this.

The problem is that Gren, who is speaking now, knows all of his abilities.

'Do you think there is a way to revive the dead!' He wouldn't have blinked an eye if he had said the same stereotype, but Gren's words, knowing his abilities, were given a certain degree of persuasiveness.

As if he knew how it felt, Gren opened his mouth again.

"I know. I know. You are the only one who has worked hard for the resurrection of your lover. But would your lover want it too?”

'How are you?'

Now the laughter was about to burst out. Zich clenched his teeth and held back the laughter that was about to come out of his mouth.

“I ask. Was Shia Rubrenter a villain?”

“What are you talking about! There was no angel like her!”

It is a woman who embraced herself with a kind smile, who had been looked down on by other servants because of her harsh impression from a young age. If she were a villain, then all the angels of the great Karwiman would be like demons.

“Then let's say she's alive, as you think. Would she like it? Do you think we will live in this world holding hands and smiling like you do?”

Kendell was speechless. All of a sudden, the shadows he was controlling lowered their bodies and were attached to the floor like a remnant.

“Now stop doing this.”

Gren said quietly.

“She doesn't resurrect, and if she does, I like your behavior.

I will not.”

Kendell was speechless. I just stared blankly at the ground.

Seeing this, Zich frowned.

The sympathy, of course, was not.

'Hey, is there anyone who really works for that?'

As if he knew that the boss in the back world who dominates a street is actually a bastard, Zich's eyes looking at Kendell were cold.

At the righteous remarks of the good protagonist, the villain realizes his mistake and repents of his sins.

'No, not that far. Does that destroy the villain's will?'

Of course, that's also a pretty musty development.

Zich seemed to be able to understand Gren's intentions only then.

'What kind of kang did you attack first, you have such a number.'

The current Kendel was a tricky guy, even Zich. However, how can Glenn, who is much less than the current Zeek, manage?

If Gren was a righteous person according to his image, he wouldn't mind such a thing, but if he was a person with a conspiracy, as Zich's guess, there would be an alternative that he had in mind.

'And that would be the alternative.'

As if he had known beforehand, Gren gave Kendell a piece of advice that was very similar to Zich's point of view, and it seemed to work.

A guy named Kendell Isid looked crazy, but Zich was quite convinced.

'It must have been that love for Sia Rubrenter was real.'

But that was the only thought that Zich had.

'But what is that? Is it okay to cause harm to others if I love them?'

What does it mean to be different from you? Is the love that Kendell pursued greater than the power he sought?

'It's bullshit.'

In any case, harming others to get what you want is the same. In other words, Zich himself and Kendel are of the same race.

'And I'm the villain.'

Naturally, Kundell also becomes a villain.

No, to be honest, I don't need such a headache. Kendell almost killed Yohai Im and Evelynn.

'You mean you end up like that?'

something that will never be tolerated. So I intervened.

match! match! match!

Zich applauded. He hit it with so much force that neither Gren nor Kendell couldn't hear him.

“Hey, I enjoyed the fun scene.”

Gren frowned. When he 'persuaded' Kendall, he stayed still and relaxed for a while, but when he moved again, he became alert.

Kendell's reaction was a little more passionate. The empty expression he had just made before went somewhere and a hateful line of sight was shot.

“Great, Mr. Gennard. Is it really Kar Woman's honorary paladin? How can you convince criminals with just words? As an honorary paladin, I am proud.”

' same?'

Come to think of it, there was such a thing in the information given to me by a person who gave me money in the past. That damn bastard and the one who's been telling himself now, buy Carwiman's honorable penis.

“I didn’t know you would have such information.”

“When it comes to information monopoly, I have something to say. Wasn't it Mr. Zich who first figured out Kendell Isid? It’s also secretly from other people.”

"of course. I have no intention of saying anything about it. Besides, he even made good use of that information. Didn't you convert Kendell Isid like that?"

“It’s not a conversion. There was a piece of conscience left in his heart, and I only believed it.”

“Well, no matter what number I used, it definitely worked. It looks like he has lost his will.”

'… What number did you use?'

Kendell raised his chin slightly.

But Gren couldn't see that gaze as he was wary of Zich.

“He’s a pretty strong guy, so I was thinking about how to take him down, but I’m glad I was able to persuade him with just a few words. My colleagues will be arriving soon. At least it definitely took time.”

“That’s what I meant… !”

Gren said something, but Kendell couldn't hear anyone else anymore.

'•••persuade? Are your colleagues arriving too?'

In Kendell's head, Zich's words are slowly reassembled.

The two are the same Carwiman's honorary genitals. In other words, there is a possibility that the two guys made something.

'While I was just arguing, enough time has passed for their comrades to arrive. That means he was dragging time?' In addition, Zich's 'no matter what number he used' was caught. Isn't it like saying that he literally didn't choose any means and methods to earn that time?

If I had used a fair number, I wouldn't have said that. So, what is an unjust number?

'•••A word to me.'

That was exactly what came to mind. However, he would not have said that because he had a conversation during a battle. If so, it means that there are some things that are not justified in those words.

'•••lie?'

The horrifying word reached Kendell's consciousness.

After all, he was giving up on everything. Still killing time in an unfavorable situation. And that was because of the baseless three tongues of a single human who knew all his abilities.

' no way!'

Kendell's gaze turned to the two who seemed to be arguing. One was the one who tried to dry himself. And the other was the one who insulted not only himself but also his lover.

Then I heard Zich's words again.

“So, as an honorary paladin, in the same position as you… .”

No words were heard after that.

'They're both, they're the same?'

Kendell's head, which had been empty for a moment, suddenly became clear.

“Uhhhhhhhhhh•••.”

A faint laugh escaped his mouth. Zich and Gren turned to Kendell.

“Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!”

creepy laughter. This is not a normal situation. Gren was perplexed.

“Why? !”

“What an asshole!”

Whoops!

Kendell slapped his fist in the cheek. Gren's face hardened. But as blood dripped from his swollen cheeks and lips, Kendell continued to laugh.

“I was stupid! To believe in the same guy who treated my Shia as garbage, the first time I've ever seen it!"

Kendell's eyes lit up with blood.

“How dare you make fun of me with nonsense!”

“No, no! I didn't fool you! Really, you can't resurrect the Sia Rubrenter... !”

“Shut up! I don't believe anything you say! Whatever the future holds, at any cost, I will bring my lover back to life!”

“If your lover comes back to life, you won’t like it!”

Gren shouted urgently, but it didn't work for Kendell.

“You can live in hiding! After all, we were on the run! If we go to a place far away from the rumors of the incident I have caused and live in hiding, no one will interfere with our happiness!”

no longer speaks Gren sensed that and bit his lip.

Kendell smiles madly and pulls out the shadows.

And when Zich saw that, he laughed like crazy inside.

'Oh, that's right! Whoever wants to go through with their own atonement!'

It was absolutely unacceptable.

From the shadow Kundell drew to deal with Gren, to the one drawn again this time, nearly 70 shadows surrounded Zich and Gren.

Gren looked at Zich with his axe's eye. It was the first time after returning to see Gren like that, Zich, but of course it was nothing.

Rather, I felt comfortable. Before returning, it was the gaze that Gren had always received.

'It was rather creepy that he was sending warm eyes like an adult.'

“What are you going to do with this!”

"What?"

Watching the shadows seeping from all directions, the two of them shouted at each other with their backs to each other.

“Didn’t things go wrong because of you!”

“What do you think I did?”

“The opponent must have lost his will! Your words have made him move again!” That's right. Zich cleverly reassured him by saying something that stimulated Kendell.

If he had lost his will by that, I was thinking of taking a more direct action.

But I didn't even have the slightest intention of admitting it. This is not the time before the regression we just left.

“No, I just had a few conversations with you! Seriously speaking, it's a bit of an argument!"

“So that's what provoked him.

Only words!”

“It’s just because he’s trash and he’s running rampant! Go out and get someone else to ask! The evil guy who picked up and killed only people, even lovers, repented with just a few words of your words, then his personality rotted again with a few words of mine, and he began to run rampant!”

Gren had nothing to say. Anyone could see that Zich was right.

It was just that Kendell was a guy with a few words like that. But it was impossible to prove it.

“Anyway, the fact that we have to defeat that bastard hasn’t changed! It's a little hard, but wait a little longer! Because you've saved time, we'll be on our side soon!"

As soon as Zich's words were finished, a presence was felt from the other side of the aisle.

It was Zich and Lara. When they see the two men surrounded by the shadows, they shout something.

Hans, Snock, and Lara rushed in with their swords in front, while Lyla and Elena stopped a little distance before preparing the chorale.

Kendel noticed them too.

' Damn it!'

He wanted to thoroughly beat up the bastard who despised himself and his lover and the con artist who tried to deceive him with nonsense lies, but he couldn't waste any more time here.

It's because the two guys also have pretty good skills, and the guys running right now can't be vigilant.

In the end, Kendell reaped the shadows. And ran through the door.

"Damn it!"

Gren stopped chasing after him. This inside is really the realm of Kendell Isid. Even he was in danger if he went in recklessly.

At least not alone.

“Gren!”

Fortunately, Lara called him and ran to him. Lara's skills are quite good. It will be helpful enough.

'It would have been easier if I had a shield!'

The combination of only two swordsmen using swords and the combination of two swordsmen and shield warriors have different levels of stability.

In the still unresolved situation, he felt frustrated and irritated with her.

However, Gren suppressed the irritation with the patience of long experience.

“Fortunately, no injuries appear.”

"okay. It’s thanks to them.”

Lara pointed to Zich and his companions. Gren's eyebrows furrowed slightly. In spite of the fact that he had a fight with Jik, he had a debt.

No, to be precise, if it was 'Gren Jennard, the honorary paladin of the just Carwiman,' you would think of it as a debt.

So Gren lowered his head for a moment.

“Thank you for that. Thank you for saving Lara.”

“Oh, no. Glenn is bow your head Phil  I do not. It was me who helped.”

“But Browning is not my colleague. And because I left you behind, my heart was very heavy.”

"It's because I can't keep up with Gren's pace though. That's why I said I'd stay."

'That was the reason Lara Browning was left alone.'

If the speed is definitely not right, it gets in the way. Because of that, didn't Zich also leave Hans and Snock behind?

However, the situation is completely different with Zich.

Gren and Lara were doing good. If you look at the situation, condell can come at any time.

Abandoning the inexperienced Lara there may seem like giving up her life at first glance.

But Jack is different. He is chasing Kendall. In other words, those left behind will never encounter Kendall. In addition, there is a situation in which the standby troops will come to the rear to provide support.

'Did you ever think you could die?'

When Gren hits trash, Lara will be one of his hands. It is also a hand that Gren cherishes as much as he carries it with him.

'It's strange to throw away a hand like that.'

Then something popped into Zich's head.

'I said I was recommending a shield. Maybe it's not Lara Browning that he wants, but Lara Browning with a shield?'

And looking at the current situation, Browning hasn't dropped his sword yet. When you think about it, you may have thought that it really doesn't matter if you die.

'No, even if it wasn't so bad, it could have been a little less painful.'

Zich observed the two of them meaningfully.

Lyla came over to Zich.

"what are you doing? Are you not chasing Kendell Isid?”

“That’s fine.” Gren received her words.

“It was a dead end. There will be nowhere to go.”

"okay?"

“But it must be his territory. You have to be alert.”

Gren stepped inside the iron gate. Then he turned his head to look at Zich.

"I once more to persuade you  will. Please do not disturb me this time.”

“I would have said that I never interfered. And in the future it will work

I don't think. But, well, I have no intention of hindering the attempt.”

Zich pointed his hand into the door.

“You go first. Please, I pray that your eloquence that resonates with the villain’s heart will work.”

For a moment, their eyes collide. Gren turned his head coldly and entered the iron gate. Lara followed behind him with a puzzled face.

“What happened?”

Lila asks. Zich briefly explained what had just happened.

“That guy is holding a tantrum. There's nothing wrong with you in common sense. Who knows how they're going to go crazy there?"

"right! After all, you know my heart well!”

“But did you mean it?”

“… What is your intention?”

“Do you think I see you for a day or two?”

When Lyla fired, Zich shrugged. It is an act no different from that of a poet.

“Well, it’s what you did, so I won’t say anything. Let's find out why Why did you say something to stimulate him again?”

If things had gone the way Gren had intended, this case would have ended here.

Did he just want to fuck Gren? But Lyla thought it wasn't because of those feelings. And when I saw Zich's face, I was convinced.

Now, he was smiling at the occasional demon king.

Even Hans and Snock take a step back, and Elena grabs Lyla's sleeve. That's how scary Zich's smile was.

“I was just judging by comparison.”

“What do you compare?”

“‘You realize that everything you’ve done was useless, and you sit down in vain’ and ‘You don’t achieve your goal by one end due to external interference even though you’ve tried all means and methods to achieve your goal’ what you can't do'. Which of the two is more resentful and bitter?”

“•••So what is your judgment?”

“Of course the latter.”

Zich said as he stepped into the iron gate.

“He must shudder with resentment and anger. Seeing the purpose that was smashed in front of my eyes due to the obstacle ‘I’.”

Lila felt Zich's back look like a snake wriggling and wriggling at its prey.

* * *

The passage inside the iron gate was not much different from the passage they had run so far. It was just a narrow hole in the aisle.

The passage continued, which would be cramped even if only three people went side by side. But soon a change occurred.

Visit!

The liquid touched my toes. But it wasn't half the water. It wasn't transparent. It was very black, as if the sticky darkness had been turned into a liquid.

"be careful! It seems like it's just starting soon!"

Zich said to the group. Still, the sound of battle was still coming from the front. It's probably from Gren and La La.

Zich also stopped running and started walking.

Slurry!

how long have they been walking A ripple broke out on the water surface from the front, and a black figure sprung up.

'Is it a shadow?'

Zich pointed at Windur and looked at it.

'It's not a shadow.'

But it will be similar. The substances that made up their bodies were like the liquid they were treading on, but their appearance and movement were very similar to shadows.

Slurry!

They happen more around.

“What is that?”

Lyla frowned.

"I do not know. Let’s call it liquid shadow for convenience.”

“I’ve been thinking about it for a long time, but you have no sense.”

“It’s full of battle sense.”

The group marched forward, smashing them all up from here and there.

They were definitely strong. Weaker than shadow humans, but stronger than normal shadows.

In addition, there were also those who attacked by surprise, often rising from the feet of Zich's party, which was annoying.

However, Zich's group repulsed them smoothly. Sieg and Hans thoroughly block the approaching bastards and launch a counterattack.

Lyla drove the approaching liquid shadows and exploded them, and Elena repulsed them with some magic that she had now become quite proficient in.

Snock lifted the ground at all, creating a space where the liquid did not reach. How long have you been moving forward like that?

Suddenly, my vision was clear.

They arrived in a huge cavity. The common floor was filled with black liquid. In the center of it, there was a topography protruding like an island.

You can see Gren and Lara, who have already arrived on the island. They were surrounded by a bunch of shadow men.

Gren was screaming in a state of siege. Apparently, he didn't stop persuasion.

However, given the circumstances, it did not seem to be very effective. As evidence of that, Kendell's face showed nothing but great anger.

'okay! Well done! What's his nonsense! Ignore it and just replace it!'

Zich fervently cheered for Kendell inwardly.

“Geek.”

Then Lyla tapped him on the shoulder.

“Look over there.”

Zich looked where Lyla was pointing.

It was in the middle of the island. There was something at the end of the high artefact, as if holding a sacred offering in the sky.

Pale skin as if discolored and a face with no vitality. It was clearly a human corpse, submerged in the half-black liquid.

It was someone he had never seen before, but Zich knew immediately who the corpse was.

'Sia Rubrenter.'

It was definitely her.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 303 screen

'I know he's been dead for a while, but he's pretty good.'

Perhaps it's because of the structure supporting her or the black liquid that half-covered her body. Zich also looked around the island.

'The missing people were here.'

Unlike the corpses of the Shea Rub Renter, who receive special treatment, the bodies of the missing people are dumped around the island.

was appearing above the black liquid

treated like garbage. Kendell probably didn't think more than that.

Kendell glanced at Zich and the others. His face was contorted with anger at once.

said Lyla.

“You seem really welcome.”

"right? There are many graces that I have bestowed on him. He is a man who knows the morals.”

The eyes of the three men who did not take their eyes off Kendell from behind turned to Zich for a moment.

In such a situation, he had been trained enough to imprint Zich on his instincts to not take his eyes off his opponent, but he had no choice but to listen to his dog.

The shadow humans who had been clinging to Gren began to run towards Zich.

At the same time, several more shadow humans stood up from the surrounding black liquid.

"huh!"

Zich snorted and pointed Windur forward. Sure, they're tough guys by themselves, but that's why they brought their comrades.

Only that level of shadow humans could handle it enough.

'There is no need to fight around here!'

Zich stomped his foot. The black liquid around it bounced off at once, revealing a squishy ground.

The cavity rumbled loudly, and the ground that Zich stepped on was hollowed out. He transferred that power to his arm and swung his sword.

Aww!

A torrent of huge magical power. Besides, very

or sharp and hard. A few shadow humans approaching were caught in the sword attack and suffered serious injuries.

That was the beginning. Windur's light continued to flash across the cavity, striking the shadow men.

Snock raised the ground around him, smashed the footholds of the shadow men, and lifted up the rock to cover them.

However, it was also magic that was glamorous and powerful.

Aww!

Brilliant fireworks are embroidered. A flame that engulfed several of the approaching shadow humans in an instant.

They couldn't deal with the shadow humans at once, but they all obviously took a lot of damage. The last blow flew to those still staggering.

Whoops! Whoops! Whoops!

A few fireballs that flew with precision mercilessly burned the sobbing shadow men.

It belonged to Elena, who was learning magic from Laila in the midst of the fortress and showing off her talent dazzlingly.

The shadow men knelt and fell on the black liquid.

Their bodies turned black. As they melted, they turned into shadows and absorbed back into the black liquid.

“It’s nothing!”

Zich shouted loudly as if to hear him.

But Zich's confidence was too quick.

Whoa!

Shadows rise again from the black liquid. They slowly began to take shape, and soon changed into human form.

So far, no surprise. It was just like any other shadow human being made.

But the moment he saw the shadow man's face, Zich tilted his head.

“Hey, Lyla. Isn't that the one we just killed?"

“It looks that way in my eyes.”

An ominous and annoying thought flashed through my mind. And Gren loudly reassured the idea.

“They don't die in this space! Revived from the black liquid!”

“… Is that so?”

As Lyla spoke, Zich scratched the back of the head.

“It’s bothering me.”

The resurrected shadow humans ran again. Zich swung his Windur face to face.

“Go ahead little by little like this! Go up to the island first!”

Zich's group moves forward one step at a time. The shadow men continued to cling.

The shadow humans who couldn't kill were very annoying, but that didn't stop Zich's group from advancing.

Kendell saw it and sharpened his teeth.

“Twitch!”

He bit his tongue and waved his hand once. For a moment, some of the shadow humans who were attacking Zich and Gren's party retreated.

I can afford it. Zich's group quickly came up to the island. Naturally, I got closer to Gren and his friends.

“Wow, nice to meet you. The persuasion you tried didn’t seem to work.”

At Zich's ridicule, Gren looked at him. But Zich was already looking elsewhere.

“•••What does that do?” The shadow humans who retreated were scattered and heading somewhere.

“What do you think you are looking for?”

“I see. What is that?”

Lila really admired Zich.

Having argued once before passing through the iron gate and scratched his insides with ridicule, this time he calmly asks a question. How blatant is that?

No matter how good-natured, or even Gren pretending to be good-natured, did he feel a little upset about this? While wielding the tornium, he sharply glared at Zich.

“Why are you asking me that?”

“Are you saying you know his abilities? Then you don't even know that."

“Why do I have to teach you that?”

“Aren’t you trying to err in public affairs with personal feelings by becoming four and four of the world’s best Carwiman honorary genitals? How the world will laugh at you.”

I don't know if this is convincing or sarcastic. No, those who listened to Zich clearly judged it to be the latter.

However, it was also true that Zich's words dug into Gren's weakness.

“… Probably trying to put shadows on the corpses. The shadows in their corpses become much stronger.”

"indeed… .”

'Wasn't it just left as trash?'

There must have been a reason why it was not dealt with.

“But the bodies won't move much. For a shadow to dwell, it has to be a corpse that has not been dead for a certain amount of time.”

Gren glanced at Sia Rubrenter's corpse.

“Unless you take proper care.”

One by one, as Gren said, the shadow men approached the corpse wallowing in the black liquid, then knelt down and placed their hands on the corpse.

Shadows touching the corpse The human fingertips turn black. Then it began to be absorbed by the body like rainwater flowing into the dry soil.

Glitter!

A corpse completely imbued with a shadow man opens its eyes. The pale complexion and the bulging eyes were enough to give people a sense of fear.

iron puck!

A black liquid splashed on the body, and the body sprung up. Movement itself is never a human movement. The rising corpses gradually increased.

Jack asked again.

“Hey, Mr. Jennard. Aren't they going to die too?"

“As far as I know, yes.”

Aaaaaah!

The corpses roared loudly and began to charge like a lost animal.

pooong

they jumped high Black liquid splashed out in all directions.

Like a hawk flying from the sky toward its prey, it landed toward Zeeke and his party. No, it's stuck down.

Aww!

Windur slashes his body. Estelaide and tornium also defended against the attacks of corpses, respectively.

'You're strong.'

The hand holding Windur throbbed. If such things attacked without dying, it would certainly be a huge threat.

'Is there only one way?'

Jack turned his head. In the central part of the island, Kendel can be seen standing like a guardian of an artifact holding up Sia Rubrenter's corpse.

'You have to hit the master of power.'

Gren was also looking at Kendell, apparently thinking the same thing as Zich.

“You seem to be thinking the same thing.”

“I guess.”

Zich looked at his party.

Hans and Snock, faithful to their teachings. Lila, who is considered to be on the same level as her own when it comes to magical talent.

And even though it was a short time, Elena, a genius who was well-trained by Lyla, was a genius.

“Lyla.”

“Don’t worry and go.”

After Lyla fired her magic, she chinked at Kendell.

“I can hold out long enough until you kill him.”

"great!"

Zich looked at Gren and said.

“Are you going?”

"•••browning!"

“Yeah, Gren!”

“Could you spare some time with these guys?”

Lara cut the shadow approaching her. and said with a smile.

"Sure!"

Gren nodded and looked at Kendell again.

“Let’s go.”

Gren swung the tornium loudly, causing the surrounding shadows, shadow men, and corpses to retreat.

Naturally, they immediately tried to attack Gren again, but there was a sword in front of him.

“I can’t go any further than this!”

Lara's sword filled with magical power deflected their attacks.

“I go too!”

“Come on!”

Seeing off from Laila, Zich also started running.

He circles Windur to dislodge the enemies who are trying to capture him. Estelaide's light swallowed the enemies who were trying to pursue him.

'You're fighting with that guy. I'll see you live a long time.'

Zich looked at Gren's back. Before returning, fight with the enemy who killed you. In a way, it is a situation that can arouse strange emotions.

But Zich's heart was cold.

'There is a high probability that it is a scammer, but what is the excitement?'

Rather, the battle with Gren was annoyed.

'What kind of guy fights with me on a level similar to Hans.'

I'm glad it doesn't bother you, let alone help. But I couldn't help it. Whether that guy's true form is a good man or a swindler, he'll definitely try to kill Kendall.

He and Lara Browning aren't with him, so they can't give directions.

But Zich took control.

'Let's think positively.'

I didn't think Kendell would be here without any defenses.

'So I guess I can just leave it to Gren.'

And you just have to aim for your true goal.

'Are you coming?'

Kendell stared at the two men running towards him with gloomy eyes.

One is a bastard who threw all kinds of insults on himself and his lover. Another is a scammer who tried to deceive himself. Both are terribly hateful bastards.

'I'd rather be fine. They kill me with my hands!'

So, he decided to engrave in his own eyes what their bone marrow looked like.

Slurry!

A shadow climbs up Kendall's body and covers it like armor. Kendell grinned at the immense power flowing through his body.

It was Gren, who also ran ahead of Zich, who started to fight Kendell first.

He lifted the tornium high and slammed it towards Kendell. Kendell also swung his hand covered in shadows.

quaang

A roar rang out.

“Sin no more, Mr. Isid! Your purpose cannot be fulfilled!”

As if he was not tired yet, Gren cried out with a sad look. But that voice only made Kendell's bua grow.

I don't even want to talk anymore.

“Shut up and search!”

Kendell attacked Gren with his other hand.

Aww!

As Gren escaped, Kendell's attack hit the pitiful ground. The ground was hollow and the surrounding land was cracked and cracked.

It was incredible power.

But Gren did not give up and ran once more.

After several workshops, Zich arrived.

"OK! Don't deal with both of them at once!"

It was time to face Gren with one hand and Kendell with the other to prepare for Zich's impending attack.

Zich distanced himself from the battle point. Started running round and round from Kendall.

M 2"

Gren and Kendell both tilted their heads. But when he realized where Zich was heading, Kendell's complexion turned pale.

“That child, maybe… !”

The place where Zich was headed was where the body of Sia Rubrenter was located.

Zich, who was running, turned his head. and smiled softly.

“Hey, Candel Isid! Surely you needed a corpse to resurrect your wife?”

(Continued on next page)

# No. 304 screen

It took Kendall a little while to understand Zich's words. It wasn't because of his wit. Because it was something he didn't want to accept.

When he understood Zich's words, his anger rose.

“Hey, this child!”

Koo!

After letting Gren back down with a big attack for a while, Kendell hastily pursued Zich.

For him, the body of his lover is more important than his life. Not a single scratch was tolerated.

Is it definitely because it's in their domain? Kendell's physical ability was significantly higher than when Zich was chasing him. He caught up with Zich in an instant.

“Die!”

The human who aroused his anger from one to ten. Putting all his resentment into this one blow, Kendell attacked Zich's back.

I see Zich moving Windur. But it's already too late. Even if you react now, you can't avoid at least a fatal injury.

An exhilarating smile formed on Kendel's face. But the smile faded faster than it appeared.

Zich didn't try to stop Kendell's attack. He didn't even look back as if he didn't even think about it. A powerful sword emanates from Windur.

Its target was the Sia Rubrenter.

“Ouch!”

A groan escaped Kendall's mouth. When he stopped attacking Zich and tried to run to Shia, his body was under load.

Still, as it was an attack full of resentment that I had been receiving so far, when I tried to stop the attack, it had to be even more difficult.

However, Kendel displayed superhuman strength and was able to stop the attack and run in front of Sia Rubrenter.

quaang

Nervously, he scatters the sword that Zich fired. I quickly inspected Shia's body. Fortunately, there was no damage anywhere.

“Oh, I’m sorry. It was a small difference.”

A hateful voice is heard. With a force enough to tear it apart and kill it with just a glance, Kendell stared at Zich. However, it didn't work for Zich either.

“You, you bastard!”

“Yeah, you think so too, don’t you? If it had been one more second, the body would have been split in two. You just keep attacking me. Why did you run away in such a hurry?”

He smiled and added.

“Are you sure it’s a piece of meat that has been lost in the past?”

Kendell's eyes widened. The shadow that covered him wriggled. It seems to represent his feelings.

I jumped right into Zich. A shadow stretched from his arm, and soon turned into a sharp spear.

It doesn't matter if it's head, neck, or heart. I was thinking of making a big, very big hole in Zich's body anywhere.

But Zich's behavior was very vile.

Take one big step sideways. I didn't mean to dodge the attack. It was just that there was no obstacle called Kendell between him and Shia's body.

Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

This time, three swords fly. Zich's great magic control did the job.

One flew in a straight line, but the two swords twisted the orbit to draw a parabola.

Kendell clenched his teeth. Blocking the straight sword, the shadow stretched out and struck the other two swords.

Then Zich approached Kendell.

“Ahhhhhhhh!”

Windur, who had a lot of magical power, slammed Kendall down.

Quang!

Fortunately, Kendell blocked Zich's attack. However, he was in a hurry to block it, so his body faltered.

But Kendell didn't feel threatened. His shadow armor is sharp, hard, and free of form. He quickly regained his composure and tried to inflict a fatal wound on Zich.

However, once again, his intentions failed.

"profit!"

Even as he clenched his teeth, he pulled back and slashed all the swords that went back to Shia's body.

"okay! work hard! If you are a little late, your precious princess will be hurt! No, is it the chunk of meat that used to be a princess?”

Moreover, the derogatory words that Zich heard from time to time faithfully gnawed at Kendell's mind.

He obtained tremendous power and ability by chance, but he had little actual combat experience. kidnap a lover

Even with the shadows, he couldn't build proper combat experience.

In the first place, his purpose was only to revive the Sia Rubrenter, and he did not intend to live a life that required combat experience.

The result was now, the appearance of Kendall, who is flustered by Zich's actions and words.

But Zich never gave up.

Koo!

The tentacles of the shadow are locked in the place where Zich is avoiding. The power to punch a clean hole in the hard floor was real. Even Sikra would be fatally wounded if he was careless.

Naturally, Zich had no intention of being vigilant, nor did he intend to deal directly with Kendall.

Koo!

Kendell defended the tornium that flew again. Kendell responded nervously.

Gren is also one of the characters Kendell wants to kill. But now, there was no time to be entangled in such a petty grudge.

“Shut up!”

quaang

Kendell turned around nervously, striking Gren. As Gren captured Kendall, Zich was rushing towards Shia's body.

Kendell's hair stood on the edge of how happy he looked.

Windur falls towards Sia's neck. Kendell barely slipped through them.

Another roar echoed around. When the attack was blocked, Zich ran backwards without hesitation. And as he was, he spit out magical energy and blew out the sword.

"what are you doing! Come on, don't stop! If it's even a little late, will it hurt your precious lover? That's right, good job! Yes, keep stopping like that! Protect your sweet lover!”

“I can’t stop!”

“Where in the world is the idiot who stops telling me to stop! Besides, why stop doing this fun thing?”

Clearly, the situation would be Carwiman's honorary genitalia Zeik, hired by the city to subdue Kendell Isid, who kidnapped and murdered people, but the plot was the exact opposite.

A pure man trying to protect his lover and a mean villain tormenting him.

Finally, Gren spoke up.

“Stop it, Mr. Zich! What are you doing now!”

But Zich was calm. First of all, if it was Gren who had the face of a good man, he expected that of course he would have to say something like that.

“What are you doing? You're beating Kendell Isid, a mean and evil villain?"

Meanwhile, the attacks on Shia's body continued. Rather, he asked.

“What are you doing? Without attacking Kendell Isid right now.”

“How mean and wicked! Isn't that what you're doing!"

'You will come out like that.'

Zich snorted.

“I have no desire to talk to you about differences of opinion right now! If you want to wear it, wear it, if you don't like it, take it off!" And Zich ignored Gren and thoroughly attacked Kendall, Sia Rubrenter.

Zich's sophisticated skills continued to breathe. Each one is a very weak skill, so it is easy to defend.

Nevertheless, it had enough power to cut through the corpse, and Kendell had no choice but to defend it frantically.

And Zich continued to use the gaps that were exposed.

Gren watched it anxiously.

'Damn it!'

What choice should I make? What he wants is fame. Originally, he had to solve everything from the identification of the criminal to the execution. However, the situation was distorted from the beginning due to the jingle jingle variables of Zekra.

Fortunately, he found conclusive evidence of Kendell Isid, but Zich, who identified him as the prime suspect, also contributed a lot.

If that's the case, I'd have to put a wedge on Kundell directly, but the way things are going now is making it difficult.

The plan to point out loopholes in Kendell's plan and to lose his courage was shattered long ago.

If that's the case, I'll have to kill Kendall, but this guy's skills aren't that great.

Moreover, decisively, Zich is pushing Kendall's weakness by tenaciously.

In any case, the best ball would be lost to Zich.

'I can't help it!'

In the end, Gren had no choice but to run to Kendell.

“Ha ha! After all, you understand me too!”

Zich exclaimed cheerfully.

“Now, let’s work together to punish that ruthless villain! Oh, but you don't have to do anything nasty!”

Zich secretly blew Kendell's attack into a head-on collision with Gren. And he ran towards Shia's body.

"happy… No, I will do the dirty work!”

“I can’t stand there!”

Kendell put a check on Zich.

But it didn't work like it used to. It was because Gren was tenaciously clinging to his life.

In the end, he missed one of Zich's sword skills.

“I can’t, darling!”

Kendell screamed. Fortunately for him, this attack only lightly scraped his forearm. But it was important to him that Sia Rubrenter's body had been wounded.

“Protect Shia!”

He gave orders to his men. But that didn't work either.

The men had been calling from a while ago, but they were completely blocked by Zich's party.

Some tried to forcefully leave the battlefield, but Laila's huge magic attack directly hit her defenseless and exposed back, returning to nothing and wasting power.

In the meantime, this time, the sword cut through the forearm of the corpse. This wound was quite large.

“These motherfuckers! You guys are still Carwiman’s honorary paladins!”

Kendell shouted, but Zich snorted and didn't respond.

So was Gren. Having come this far, Gren had to kill Kendell with his own hands.

Kendell grinded his teeth. If you go on like this, all that's left is your own defeat.

That means, soon, his grand plans will fail.

And that meant the complete death of his lover.

'I can't let it be like that!'

The moment Gren charged once more and Zich threw his sword at Shia.

Kendell's shadow shook once more.

Aww!

“Wow!”

Gren stepped back. Zich also hurriedly defended against the attack from the side with Windur.

Koo!

Zich took a few steps back to see what was attacking him.

'You are the shadow man of Sia Rubrenter.'

An enemy who was exceptionally strong among the shadow humans who attacked Yoheim and Evelyn in the past. And to them, he was also a shadow man who identified a suspect named Kendall.

'It was strange not to use it.'

I wondered if there had been a deterioration in performance because of the wounds he had made in the past, but the shadow man in front of him had no wounds from Zich.

It was also doubtful that the performance was degraded by the previous attack.

'Then it is most likely an emotional reason.'

Zich's prediction was correct.

'I didn't want to write Sia!'

Otherwise, the shadows that Candel can handle are limited. Because of this, when attacking those investigating him, he had no choice but to send Shia with the best performance.

But then, Shia's Shadow Man was seriously wounded, and Kendell, frightened, had no choice but to retreat immediately. And I didn't want to use her shadow man again.

But now it is unavoidable.

'I'm still an anxious sheep, but... .'

Kendell looked at Sia's shadow man for a moment. I wanted to collect a little more, a little more shadows.

' it's okay.'

Kendell expounded himself.

'I did my best! And Sia will surely answer me! Because our love is absolute!'

Sia's shadow The human moved. The destination is where her body is. Kendell stood guarding her back.

"what?"

Zich blinked. Judging from the situation, it seemed that he was planning to put the shadow of Hanissia Rubrenter inside the corpse.

'Isn't there still a lack of shadows?'

But my body reacted faster than I expected. He swung it with magical energy as if it was about to explode in Windur.

Koo!

blocked by Kendall. But that was already expected. Rather, it was deceitful. Zich flew to a place opposite to where the sword flew. And then again he flew several swords. Gren also swung the tornium one after another, apparently not wanting to resurrect Sia.

However, Kendell's generous movements were all blocked. Kendell was venomous, blocking some attacks with his body. There were no injuries blocked by the shadows, but that was proof that Kundell was desperate.

Thanks to his efforts, Shia's shadow man was able to successfully enter his corpse.

Zich and Gren stepped back for a moment.

“What happened, Mr. Gennard? Wasn't Sia Lubrentor's Shadow Man still unfinished?"

Gren couldn't properly answer Zich's question. It was evident from his experience as well.

“•••Of course it will. Otherwise, there is no reason not to resurrect it yet, given the author’s personality.”

“It is.”

Jack agreed.

“Then, is it simply trying to make the body move? Seriously, if it were that shadowy human corpse, there would be one stronger than the others. They seem to be trying to kill us and gather the shadows again.”

“•••As far as I know, a shadow once placed on a corpse cannot come back.”

Zich frowned. That was nonsense.

“Is that crazy guy giving up on his lover’s resurrection simply to get out of the current crisis?”

“… I can't believe it either.” Surprisingly, for now, Zich and Gren agreed. However, the situation will not be resolved if we continue to have conversations here. The two rushed to Kendell, whoever came first. Exactly, he tried to block the corpse infiltrated by the shadow man of Sia Rubrenter beyond him.

But Kendell's silent defense was really hard. He desperately blocked the attacks of Zich and Gren.

And Kendell's efforts were clearly rewarded.

Dream!

Sia Rubrenter's fingers, who were lying down, twitched. Its movement increased more and more. My toes moved and my palms flipped. Arms extended to the side, knees slightly raised. And my eyelids trembled.

flash!

Sia Rubrenter's eyes were opened. It jumped up the upper body. Like a mannequin, it looked at Zich, Gren, and Kendall. Sia's mouth opened slightly. She was pursing her mouth without a sound as if a baby was babbling.

“… Candel?”

A voice came out of her throat.

Pot!

Kendell turned his head. It was in the midst of a fierce battle, so it was certainly a fatal gap, but Kendell could not stand it.

The words he heard now were the voices he had long lost and really wanted to hear.

“Sia!”

Kendell exclaimed loudly. Her face, her hair, her voice, and her beautiful eyes that were always hidden behind her eyelids. Everything he missed was there.

However, unlike him who fell in love with it, Sieg and Gren had neither reason nor room to fall for it. Windur and Tornium each aimed at Kendell's hollow neck and torso.

Whoops!

Shia stretched out her arms. A black energy emanated from her body.

Aww!

A roar broke out. The black energy that flew in at a flash literally blew away Zich and Gren.

Whoops! Whoops!

Two black sprays soared out of the island.

“Zeek!”

“Gren!”

Lyla and Lara were startled and called out their names aloud. Others were astonished. It seemed dangerous to see Zeeg and Gren drowning in the black liquid.

Fortunately, the two were not seriously injured.

“Ah, damn it! It's enough to fly with Lyla's magic."

Zich groaned as he brushed off the black liquid. Gren also got up using the tornium as a staff.

Kendell, released by the two of them, went to Shia. His eyes were full of joy.

“Sia!”

“… Candel?”

Kendell hugged her, looking at her with blank eyes.

“Ah, Sia! my sia! You are finally awake!”

Tears are dripping down from the troubled face. He wanted to see him while trampling on the happiness of others and throwing his life in the mud. Her body recovered from the despair of death... It was very cold.

Kendell lifted his face from Shia's shoulder in surprise. She sees a blank expression on her face.

“Condell?”

"okay! It's me! I'm your lover Kendall!"

“Condell… .”

“•••Sia?”

“… Condell.”

Shia's condition was strange. It is not a reaction that anyone would think of as a normal human being.

Suddenly, Sia raised her arm.

Whoops!

A black energy emanated from her hand again. Sieg and Gren, who were about to raid Kendell, hurriedly fled to either side.

“You are a very ferocious girl.”

Without losing the energy, it stretched out and made a huge hole in the common wall. Seeing that, Zich stuck out his tongue. But that was also for a while. Zich soon teased again.

“I worked hard to resurrect it, but it looks like it didn’t work right? what about this Your lover is truly broken-hearted.”

Kendell stared at Zich.

"gibberish! Her resurrection is not complete yet! That's it!”

"Ohh? So there's a chance she's still alive?"

"of course!"

Hearing those words, Zich calmed down.

'I'm really happy. Because I don't think I'll sit down in despair just because my consciousness has failed.' Zich did not give up on the idea that it would be even more desperate to see his lover's resurrection fail in front of his eyes because of his lack of strength.

Quang! Quang!

Meanwhile, Gren continued to attack. But Shia was incredibly strong. It was clearly visible that the tornium was pushed every time the workshop took place.

Kendell looked at him with delight.

“Sia is resurrected! And you will get stronger! The motherfuckers who interrupted my love! Fucking bastards who despised my love! From now on, look carefully at the resurrected Shia!”

Whoops!

A column of water rose from the black liquid around it. Gren clenched his teeth.

“That black water must not be absorbed by Sia Lubrentor's body! As the ritual proceeds, a monster will be created that is truly incomparable to what it is today!”

'The black liquid wasn't there for nothing.'

Zich found out its true identity.

"huh! How are you going to disturb me! Your companions are blocked by my power,

You too are enough to stop me alone!”

Kendell's tone was confident. It was a little messy, but in the end things were going the way he thought.

Zich also acknowledged his confidence.

'The reinforcements will come in a little while, but the situation is a bit too serious to believe.'

There was a possibility that the situation would get out of control if the Sia Rubrenter was really completed here.

Because of this, Zich used his tongue again, one of his abilities.

“Are you going to complete the Sia Rubrenter like this?”

"Yes!"

“Yeah, that’s good.”

As if he did not understand the situation, Zich said with a smile.

“As soon as she wakes up, you can recite all the evil deeds you have done.”

Condel's face hardened. At the same time, the pillars of black liquid that were approaching Sia also stopped. Zich lowered Windur. He slammed Windur upside down on the ground, leaning back like a staff and hanging down.

"what are you doing? Wasn't that perfecting your lover? do it faster. I have something serious to talk about with your lover.”

Rather, Zich worked. Kendell stared at Zich as if to kill him.

“… Candel?”

Sia calls him. Without intelligence, with doll-like eyes.

with a splash!

The column of the rising black liquid collapsed.

“•••You guys are enough with me and Shia for now.”

“Is that your answer?”

Jack smiled bitterly.

“Even if I die soon, I don’t want my lover to hear your dirty talk, right? great. Then let’s try again.”

Jack sighed and laughed.

“But you, it will be a little different from now on.”

"what?"

“You take that body!”

After talking to Gren, Zich ran to Kendell.

Quang!

The battle resumed. Kendell stretched out his shadow and tried to hit Zich's foot. However, as if reading the future, Zich had already withdrew his feet. Then he swung his Windur once more.

Quang! Quang!

Zich's Windur continues to target Kendell's vital points. But Kendell was able to block it with ease. Zich was able to pinpoint Gren and inflict no mortal wounds on Kendell. Besides, even Gren can't help because he's fighting Shia right now.

But Kendell felt things start to get a little weirder.

'Why is it getting heavier?'

quaang

Defeat Windur, who was aiming for his own neck. It seemed like an easy blow, but Kendell made an impression. Obviously, Windur digs deeper than before.

'Shit! That's it!'

Kendell clenched his fist. But this time, Zeek avoided eating his fists too easily. Jack smiled softly.

“Yeah, I’m used to it.”

quaang

Zich's fist hit Kendell's temple. A shadow defended Kendell from exploding his head, but he couldn't avoid being momentarily clouded.

Zich did not miss that moment.

A sword strike like a storm struck his body.

“Wow!”

Kendell resisted. He cut off the flying sword attack and put a counterattack on Zich instead. The effect was excellent. Zich's sword attack stopped and made him retreat.

But the situation just before was enough to intimidate Kendell.

'how?'

It's different than before. Gradually, Zich's attack was hitting him.

'He hasn't changed, has he?'

Zich's power and speed didn't change much. It has enough power and speed to respond.

But rather, it made me even more embarrassed.

“Ha ha!”

With a loud noise, Kendell stretched out a shadow. Zich evaded the attack. And he snorted inwardly.

'Now I can see everything.'

Clearly, Kendel's power and speed are much higher than the current Zich. In addition, the attack using the shapeless shadow made it possible to attack beyond expectations.

'Then what do you do? You're a beginner.'

Before I got used to it, it was very dangerous and difficult. Of course, it's dangerous even now that you're used to it.

But I have more room than the first time.

Kendell swings his fist. But Zich was already moving.

'I can see where I'm going to stretch out my fist.'

Of course, that alone is difficult to avoid. Kendell had the power of anomalous shadows. However, Kundell was using its anomalous powers regularly.

'Because there is a distance, I will increase the shadow of the arm.'

Whoo!

As Zich had expected, the shadows stretched out. However, he could not hit the jig, who had already moved one step ahead.

I could see Kendell bending his knees.

'Are you going to run forward? Using shadows?'

Tuoung!

Kendell ran forward. Zich pushed Windur into it.

Startle!

Condell was startled.

'I will spread the shadows wide.'

This is the method Kendell continued to use when he was suddenly attacked. It is a technique that can block many attacks, but it obscures the view in the current situation.

And when someone like Zich was an opponent, it was fatal to miss a move.

Whoops!

“Gagging!”

An exhilarating taste rises. Zich chuckled.

'Finally one room!'

(Continued on next page)


# No. 306 screen

He said he ate one shot, but he didn't inflict much damage. It just borrowed the power of Windur to break through the shadows and make a small hole in the leg.

But damage is damage. Moreover, it was a considerable burden for Kendell, who was not used to combat. There are very few people in the world like Zeek, who can run at an opponent with a smile while having cuts all over his body and bleeding all over the place.

“Wow!”

Kendell grabbed his leg in a burning pain. Seeing that, Zich clicked his tongue.

'I'm also a beginner.'

If Hans or Snock had reacted to each wound like that, they would have been thrown into hell training for a few days.

'Full of gaps.'

Zich pierced Windur through the widest gap. However, Kundell defended in time and the attack was blocked. But Zich was not disappointed.

'I became passive.'

That wasn't what Kendell intended. For a novice in combat, Kendel was fighting really bravely. Perhaps the obsessive desire to resurrect Sia Rubrenter is what drives him.

However, the instinct of defense, which occurs instinctively, is unavoidable even with a fierce will.

'I'm not just training for nothing.'

Whoops!

Zich's kick pierced Kendell's stomach. Kendell's face contorted. He made a large awl out of his shadow and stabbed it at Zich. But Zich took a step back and avoided it.

'It's pretty obvious.'

Zich continued the battle by attacking the gaps in the element element Condel. Then he glanced at Gren's battle.

'It's amazing.'

Their battle was one-sided. The movement of Sia Rubrenter was very simple and straightforward. It is a much more rudimentary movement than Condel.

However, his power and speed were far superior to Condel. Gren was desperately holding out, but it probably won't last very long.

'So, I have to subdue this guy quickly... .'

Zich glanced at Gren once more. That handsome face was shriveled up. Zich opened his eyes.

'Wait a little longer.'

The little devil who lived in Zich's heart chuckled.

'No, it's not intentional. This guy is not a guy that can be easily killed.'

He was gradually gaining the upper hand, but Kendell was an impossible existence if he told him to take it down immediately.

'Well, that's right. I'm doing my best.'

Zich convinced himself that way.

The time of such fierce battle passed.

Kwajik!

Once again Zeeg's Windur broke through Kendell's defenses and fell on his body. The shadow trembled.

“Wow!”

Kendell was bloodied. There were no major wounds thanks to the shadows he was wearing, but the damage had accumulated quite a bit.

'If you do this, you will really get hit!'

It was time for Kendell to grapple with the shimmering aura of defeat.

Quang!

A loud bang rang out in the cavity.

“Ah! Gren!”

The sound of howling Lara. That alone was enough to understand the situation. In the end, Gren could not withstand Shia's strong attack. Kendell's eyes lit up.

“Sia!”

Whoo!

Sia ran like the wind. She extended her fist towards Zich.

quaang

Zich's body was pushed long. The hand holding the Windur was tingling. He looked ahead. Sia stood in front of him like a guardian angel protecting Kendel. This time I looked back a little. I saw Gren lying on the black liquid. It didn't look like he was dead, but seeing that there was no movement, he seemed to have lost his mind.

'Are you really fainting? Or is it acting to hand over the Rubrent to me?'

It may have been because of the fear that Zich might lose the ball to kill Condel as he watched Zich push him.

'Well, it doesn't matter.'

Zich looked forward again.

“Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”

Kendell went mad.

“Did you see it! This is the power of Shia! It is the power of our love!”

he cried

“Dammits who interrupt our love”! With love, we can escape from any hardship! Love is the noblest and most powerful force in the world!”

'It's not like that.'

I've met people who think that way before their return. Not only love between lovers, but love between husband and wife, love between parents and children. There were people who loved the memories, there were people who loved the country, and there were people who loved the feeling of honor. They rushed to Zich with the love they believed in.

'And they were all trampled on.'

Power is just power. It is just a fictional story to overcome the hardships and trials that cannot be endured by powering up just because you have the emotion of love.

He wanted to instill that fact in Kendell, but he lacked the strength right now.

'I'm sorry.'

But for now, I will be able to give a good present as it is now.

quaang

Shia attacked Zich at random. It's a simple fist and kick, but the power it contains is terrifying. Zich had no choice but to be pushed into the defense. He seemed to be barely defending as well.

Seeing this, Kendell felt very happy. The scammers were dealt with by Sia, and the bastard will soon be dealt with.

But Kendell was not satisfied. I wanted to get rid of the jig as soon as possible. So he jumped on Zich too.

A collaboration between Kendall and Sia. The attack of the two, equipped with a formidable fighting power, further pushed Zich into a corner. Windur's speed can't keep up with his attacks, and his movements can't avoid attacks. Slowly, the wounds on Zich's body began to grow.

Beetle!

For a moment, Zich stumbled on his leg. It's the best chance Kendell clenched his fists with a smile on his face.

“Die!”

Whoops!

A terrifyingly ecstatic touch. Zich's flank was torn off. The thought of finally inflicting mortal wounds on Zich made Kendell extremely happy.

That was a mistake.

Tub!

Zich grabbed Kendell's arm, which had ripped off his side. Condell was perplexed. He tried to give his body strength, but the vigilance caused by the conviction of victory too early made his body sluggish. In addition, the small wounds Zich inflicted prevented his movement.

So he said, 'Uh, uh... !' And he had no choice but to move as Zich wanted. All I have to do is cover myself with a shadow to protect myself from what I am doing.

But Kendell wasn't too concerned. It's only for a moment And that in that brief moment, Zich could not inflict fatal wounds on himself, the battle just before had already proven.

But the attack that flew at him wasn't Zich's.

Whoops!

“Big billion!”

Kendell opened his mouth wide at the pain piercing his stomach. I couldn't even come out with a scream in excruciating pain. Screaming made the pain worse.

cry!

As he vomited blood, Kendell looked at the piercing through his stomach. It was his hand that pierced his hard shadow defense. A hand that is so fine and beautiful that even the owner can conclude that she is a beauty.

Kendell's gaze followed his hand. The face you see on the white nape of your neck, passing through your beautiful, bloody hands, through your slender forearms... , it was very lovely.

“… Candel?”

“Hey heck!”

Seeing Shia tilting her head towards him, Kendell vomited blood once more.

chin!

Someone grabs his shoulder. Kendell turned his head. Zich was looking at him. With a very kind expression.

“One of the most important things to watch out for in the original pincer is the attack of your comrades. So it requires no practice and experience. Otherwise, you could be taken advantage of by the enemy like you are now and be fatally wounded at the hands of your allies.”

Zich gave strength to his hand. Kendell's body leaned and slid out of Sia's arm. just rolled on the floor. There was a hole in his stomach.

“Hmm, if you are fatally wounded, you automatically stop. thank God. I was worried that they wouldn't move even if you died."

Zich took out a potion and sprayed it on the wounded area. New flesh sprouted on the side.

After randomly throwing the potion bottle, Zich squatted down next to Candel. And I said to him bloody. Very clearly so that I don't hear anything wrong.

“Anyway, I have seen the power of your love. A love that makes the other person bloody. It's a very rare love in the world. Don't admit it."

Zich giggled, as if the devil was whispering. That was enough to turn Kendall's stomach upside down.

w  city ​​•••ah"••• Cooker I kill this *******

female… .”

But even at his command, Shia only tilted her head.

'It looks like the owner must have some energy to be able to control it.'

As if affirming Zich's thoughts, Zich's party, including Laila, and those that were attacking Lara all stopped moving.

“It’s not okay. Your lover won't listen to you."

"Damn it… .”

Kendell clenched his fists. Tears flowed from his eyes. it felt that his plan eventually failed. His subordinates, including Shia, did not move, and he was being pierced through his stomach and dying.

he raised his arm He grabbed Zich's hem with his trembling, blood-stained hands. He gave me strength as if it was Zik's neck.

“Because of you… Hey."

"right. Because of me.”

Zich nodded cheerfully.

“I… I… Sia... I want to see you again... was only... place… . just love someone... I want to see you again… It was only... . When you interfere... on the door... !”

His hateful gaze turned to Zich. But Zich snorted. It wasn't just ignoring Kendell's hateful eyes.

“By the way, I have something prepared for you.”

Zich took out the magic box and pulled something out of it. It was a bunch of paper. Those of different sizes fluttered helplessly in Zich's hand.

Zich read the frontmost of them.

“Ned finally confessed to me.”

As of now, without ridicule or anger, I just calmly read the letters in front of me. His boldness rather emphasized what he was reading.

"pleased. My love has finally come true. Heavenly Karnasi, thank you so much. Ah, I can't believe this is real even at the moment I'm writing this. I really don't know what to write here. My love and happiness felt like my heart was about to explode, but I don't know the words to express these feelings. Just, just happy.”

Zich handed over the paper. Only the scraping of paper echoed heavily in the quiet cavity.

“I am finally going to propose to her tomorrow. If you think about tomorrow's heavy duty, you should jump into bed right away, but you can't sleep because of the tension. How will she react if she accepts my proposal? Will you smile broadly with joy? Will you weep with emotion? Will you not refuse? If I was rejected, how should I live in the future? Anyway, all that's left is execution. I hope that tomorrow's marriage proposal will be successful..."

Skip one page again.

“It’s my first time expressing my feelings in this way, so I’m a little nervous. But I picked up a pen, thinking that speaking and writing are different. Do you know how great you are to me? No, you probably don't know. No matter how much you think my feelings are, at least my feelings are definitely tens or hundreds of times bigger than that. I bet you So I thank you for everything that made you exist on this earth. And thank you for coming to me. The moments I will spend with you in the future are too much for me…”

Zich stopped reading.

They were diaries and letters written by the victims of this case. Zich held the thick-looking paper in front of Kendall's eyes.

and said

“Tell me again. this diary and

Say it again in front of your friends that you just wanted to see the person you love again.”

(Continued on next page)


# No. 307 screen

'That's what I was preparing for in the past.' Lila glanced at the papers Zich was holding.

It was also the same as feeling the emotions of the parties when I wrote that chapter one by one. And that's how much anger against Kendell rose.

Still, there was a bit of sympathy in the corner of his heart that he had committed a crime for the sake of the one he loved, but Zich's diary and letter blew those feelings away.

When Lyla glanced around, the feelings of others seemed to be the same as hers.

Before, he had shown little sympathy for Kundell, but now there was no sign of that. I'm just staring coldly.

“Your love will be noble and great. at least for you i admit it Whatever people think, it's all free. It's worse than arguing about it. by the way. As much as they place great value on the emotion of love, don't these people value the person they love very much? You have crushed the hearts of those people mercilessly. And what? Did you just want to see the person you love again?”

Zich pushed the diary and letter to Kendell a little more.

“Why don’t you say anything? If you are so confident, say it again.”

Kendell said nothing. His eyes, which continued to cast hateful glances at Zich, contained the diary in front of him.

You can see the words written in a beautiful handwriting. The emotions contained in it seem to come out at any moment and catch your eye.

“Isn’t the reason you only target your lover because of jealousy anyway? 'I lost my lover and I fell into this unfortunate thought, but are the other guys having fun with love?'. It must have been this feeling.”

“I see you can’t answer. He looks like a real piece of garbage.”

Zich slapped Kendell in the head. he moaned a little.

“Just let it go quickly.”

“… Yes, that would be nice.”

Kendell smiled mischievously. His tone, which seemed to be out of breath, suddenly returned to normal.

When Zich looked at the wound, a shadow was covering his wound. But there was no recovery. It was just holding on to life for a while.

“If you think about it, it should have been like this. If I couldn't meet you alive, I'd have to die and go find Sia."

he said with longing. Did you drop everything at the last minute? Kendell closed his eyes as if he was about to accept death naturally.

That's it. If Kendell dies like this, the disappearance case that engulfs Zanmalfi will come to an end.

'Who do you want?'

But Zich had no intention of ending it like this.

Normally, it would have been sent like this. Haven't you had a lot of fun so far? But this time I didn't want to.

'Are you touching Joachim and Evelynn?'

Zich put in the letter and diary. Those who were about to approach him also raised their hands to block them. He also ignored Lara running to Gren and helping him.

Then I spoke to Kendel.

“Do you think you will be able to meet Sia Rubrenter if you die?”

“👑! Are you saying I'm going to hell?"

Kendell smiled a little, as if he had already expected it.

“It is highly likely. But isn't it the same underworld? I can't see her in person, but if I can get a little closer to her, that's enough. And do you know? Is the underworld a different place from what we think it is? As it is said, even if I, the Carwomen, sing the songs of heaven and heaven, no one has seen it in person.”

Is it because he has already completely abandoned reality? Kendell didn't waver. But Zich didn't mean to put Kendell into despair with only these words.

“Who said Sia Rubrenter was in the underworld?”

"•••what?"

Kendell opened his eyes. With doubt in his eyes, there was a faint uneasiness. I wanted to see that. All I have to do now is to explode that anxiety.

“Your lover is here.”

Zich reached out and pointed to the corpse of Sia Rubrenter standing near them.

“If I die, of course, my abilities will be released as well.”

"okay? Well, that's what I expected. If you had such great autonomy, you would have kept moving even when there was a hole in your body. by the way. Your lover is a very special guy, right? It may remain even when you die.”

“It can’t be.”

“It can’t be. After all, you got your powers. To the guy who wore some robe.”

Condell was surprised. I didn't know I would have figured it out so far.

“Are you fully aware of abilities that are not yours? I don't think so. There may be other abilities you don't know about."

“No such thing!”

“It’s something you have to do. Fortunately, we have people who are smart with your abilities.”

Zich pointed to Gren. As if he was not dead, he was raising his upper body to Lara's support.

Seeing Gren, Kendel was perplexed.

“If your ability is really the ability to resurrect the dead, wouldn’t at least the soul of Sia Rubrenter be inside the corpse? Then even if you go to the underworld, you won't be able to meet her."

Candel looks at Sia. She is standing blankly, looking at herself. Is there really a soul in Shia's body?

Seeing that Kendel was perplexed, Zich smiled inwardly.

'right. You must never die in peace.'

“Do you know what I will do from now on?”

"What… .”

“First, I will find out more about your abilities from Mr. Jennard. And you have to do all sorts of experiments. Take your lover.”

Kendell's eyes widened.

“It’s not funny… ! Cool!”

Excited, he vomits blood as the shadow-blocked wound bursts. But Zich didn't care.

Anyway, Kendall doesn't need to talk anymore. You just need an ear to hear.

Is it enough for you to speak on your own?

"do not worry. I don't mean to insult your lover. rather the opposite. I'm going to try to save your lover."

Zich's remarks were quite unexpected to Kendell. But the mean smile on Zich's expression was never the kind that would speak to him in his favor.

“I intend to completely separate you. Will I be happy to meet you in the underworld? I will never tolerate it.”

“This child… !”

Kendell waved his arms, but already his body did not have the terrifying power that shook the earth like before.

His rebellion was too easily blocked by Zich's hand.

“And do you know what I will do after that?”

“•••Are you going to tell me all my sins?”

“Oh, is that the worst thing you can think of? But no. Oh, I'll tell you your sins. What I'm denying is that it's not your worst

that is.”

“What… .”

“I’m going to seduce your lover.”

"•••what?"

“Since then, I have a good face, and I know quite a bit of skill to seduce women.”

Kendell snorted.

"huh! Do you think my sister-in-law would just fall for such a lowly temptation?”

“o”

flaw.

Jack nodded his head.

“I understand your heart, but there are so many conditions that your faith will not be repaid. For once, you and your lover are forced to break up. When the body goes away, the mind goes away too.”

“Such common myths don’t work for us.”

“Yeah, that might not be enough. But now the situation is much worse than that. Once Sia Rubrenter finds out about your crime.”

Kendall's eyes twinkle.

“It must be very sad. Because his lover put innocent lovers in pain because of him. Besides, she has no one to turn to. You have run away from the family and you, the only person you trusted, must have been lost. How will she live, who grew up like a flower in a greenhouse?” "Well, perhaps  you might think about suicide. But that's what I'll stop thoroughly. In the end, she has no choice but to choose to live. I'm going to push Sia Rubrenter into a corner like that steadily. Of course, the body and mind will be exhausted. What would she think of the man closest to her at such a time?” Blood leaked from Kendell's lips. It's not a spit wound because of a wound on the stomach. It was fresh blood that had been biting his lips in extreme hatred.

“•••No matter what happens, Si-ah will not betray me!”

Kendell exclaimed. But Zich said sarcastically.

“You really think so?”

Normally, he would have shouted 'Yes!', but the situation was too bad for him.

Besides, they are talking, but Kendell's wounds are very big. to the point where he would soon die. of course

My head didn't turn as usual

That's why Kendel couldn't answer.

And that was the moment Zich was aiming for.

"what? What are you?”

Zich said with a smile on his face.

“Are you suspicious of your lover right now?”

(6 ।  n

"Right? Are you suspicious of Sia Rubrenter now? You think she might have a different heart if you die!”

"that… !”

“I can’t speak, so I guess it’s real?”

Jack's eyes twinkle.

“So far, you have acted as if you have no shame in your feelings for your lover, and are you saying that you are doubting your lover now with just a few words of my enemy?”

“Never!”

Condell denied it. But Zich didn't stop pushing.

"It's no use lying to me. After all, this is because your heart that you know is important. You killed people saying your lover is so important and you don't trust your lover anymore? This is more trash than I thought.”

“He said he never did!”

"It's no use lying to your heart, you bastard!"

To Kendell's shouting, Zich responded with a louder voice.

"great! One more thing to tell you when your lover is alive! Kendell Isid didn't believe you at all!"

“Bitch! Then I will kill you!”

“How are you going to kill me? After all, you must have lost it!”

Zich slapped Kendell on the cheek. Kendell had no choice but to suffer the insult.

“Just in case, what I have said so far is not a lie! If Sia Rubrenter survives, I will definitely do it!”

“Damn it! Damn it!”

Kendell tried to cast a shadow. But his shadow didn't listen. Should I just watch things go the way the devil in front of me wants?

'It would be better if Sia didn't survive!'

That was when I thought about it.

The words of Zich, who had been shouting like crazy, were cut off. His glassy eyes roll and look into Kendell's. It was as if he was seeing his own heart, so Kendel averted his eyes.

“You now… .”

But he couldn't avoid the voices ringing in his ears.

“Did you want Sia Rubrenter to just die like this?”

“111”

Kendell's heart sank. I looked at Zich to deny it. Up to this point he couldn't be sure.

If he admits his heart, everything that supports him will crumble.

But the moment he saw Zich's face, Kendell couldn't help but wonder. It was unbelievable that he had ridiculed him until now, so he had a benevolent face.

“Hey, Kendel.”

Calling me by my first name, not my last name, Zich said in a friendly and kind manner.

“Are you going to just kill Sia Rubrenter like this?”

It was the devil's temptation.

(Continued on next page)

Kendell didn't answer right away. His mind was complicated. I imagined the resurrected Shia living with a smile next to Zich.

Literally, my mind and body were twisted, and I was humiliated. Dark emotions ran through my head, crashing all over the place.

'no way!'

Even though he cannot be

that doesn't mean

So should I ask him to kill me?

But is it really right for a lover to kill a lover who can be revived because he doesn't want to find another love? Should I pray for my lover's happiness here?

His mind was torn from a deadly injury and his cunning tongue was torn apart, unable to come up with a clear answer.

And it caused the worst for Kundell.

Zich wasn't waiting for Kendell to answer. What he had been waiting for was this silence that continues now.

“Are you worried?”

Zich's mouth started moving again.

“You used to rhyme about your lover’s happiness, but now you want to die after you.”

Kendell looked puzzled.

“I know, even if you don’t tell me. In my heart, I want Sia Rubrenter to be killed, but that's because I've been stabbed by her poor conscience and can't speak. Even if you think about it, it is a very shameful contract to kill a lover out of greed. As much as you talked about the nobleness and greatness of love.”

“Oh no!”

"no? Oh, that's right. Wasn't your praise for that love just to give an indulgence to your deeds? You didn't want Sia Rubrenter's happiness. He just wanted his own happiness. You saw your lover as a puppet. A fitting for one's own desires.”

"Do not be ridiculous!"

Ignoring the pain in his stomach, Kendell grabbed Zich by the neck. However, as his life was ending, there was no strength left in his body.

His hands flowed down. But Kendell continued to reach out.

Jack didn't stop it either. Kendall's actions, such as the writhing of a flying insect, were meaningless. Rather, it just makes Zich happy.

“If you really loved Sia Rubrenter, wouldn’t you have died comfortably knowing that she could survive and start a new life? But look at you now. I want to bind a new life of love and desire in you, And there hoping that the seam of the enemy that I hate the most and want to kill your lover at heart he  is not. "

“No! You damn bastard!”

“If not, why are you so desperately in denial? If you just ignore my words, that would be all. Isn't that because there's something on your mind?"

“This dog… ! Cool!”

Kendell vomited blood. Much more blood than just before. Breathing was rapid again.

Zich glanced at his stomach and saw that the shadow that had covered the wound had faded.

'Is it the end soon?'

It's a wound that would have stopped breathing as soon as it was hit by an ordinary person. Because of his ability, he has survived until now, but it will be difficult to hold on any longer.

Zich looked into Kendell's eyes. There is not even a trace of the comfort of letting go of everything. All that is left is anger and hatred, and nervousness and despair.

It is a very satisfactory situation. The one who touched Yo Haim and Evelynn. I could never make him die in peace.

Zich looked at Sia Lubrentor once, and then looked at Condel again.

“Tell me now. Your lover, Kendell, wanted your death in the end.”

Kendell licks his lips. But no more voices came out.

Just a strange wind noise. His eyes were out of focus, and it was clear that his life was dying.

Worried that he might not be able to hear properly, Zich leaned down and whispered one last time in his ear.

“If you can see it in Hell, see it. A new love that I and Sia will grow together. As you said, that would be very noble.”

Tickle!

Kendell bounced. A final gesture made out of hatred for Zich. But it was just there.

Zich looked at Kendall's face.

I see a distorted face that seems to have been poured with all the negative emotions in this world.

But there was no further movement. Breathing stopped, and the shadow that had blocked the wound disappeared somewhere.

dead. Struggling with worries about an ill-fated future and despair over the present situation until she runs out of breath.

It was the moment when the case of the disappearance of the lover that wrapped the fine blood was concluded.

Jack woke up. With Windur on his back, he turned around. The movement was light. A kind of freshness floats on his face. It was the perfect contrast to the dead Kendell's face.

Laila, who was quietly watching Zich's sheep, walked over to him. The other party followed her and approached Zich.

"it's over?"

"okay."

“Are you satisfied?”

"perfectly."

"I'm glad."

Even if he was not satisfied with putting people in the depths of despair, he had no choice but to wake up a little, no matter how accustomed to Zeeg.

Fortunately, she seemed satisfied, so Lyla sighed as well.

She looked at Candel. He looked as if he had died with all kinds of pain. Lila clicked inwardly.

'Then why do you have to touch Joachim Dracule and Evelynn Rouge?'

If it weren't for that, even if the result of death for Zich was the same, the pain up to the process would have been a little less.

After thinking about Kendell's wrong choice for a moment, her gaze turned to Sia Rub Renter.

She, no, her corpse fell to the floor like a doll that had fallen off the string the moment Kendell stopped breathing.

Her face was calm. It was completely different from the painful face of the lover lying next to him.

It seemed to highlight the folly of The Kundell.

“Since Kendell Isid died, Sia Lou Brenter’s abilities were also released.”

“He said When he dies, his powers will be released.”

Zich replied bluntly.

Seeing that he replied that Shia's abilities would not be released even if Kendell died and then answered by asking a natural question, it was clear that Zich's audacity was truly the best in the world.

“So you mean that Kendell Isid’s last worry was in vain?”

"right. Well, I don't have any regrets because I spent the way to it inconveniently."

In addition, Zich added a word.

“Because I don’t know how to torture you until after you die.”

If there was a way to torment people like that, was he intent on tormenting them until after they died?

Even Hans, who had seen Zich's toughness the longest, trembled.

Completely disinterested in Kendel and Sia, Zich went down to the bottom of the island. Kendell's ability was cut off, and corpses were seen lying around.

They too will now visit their families and find rest. For those who sincerely hope for the survival of their families and lovers, this may be a desperate task, but it is inevitable.

The corpses also passed by, and Zich stepped out of the island. The black liquid also disappeared after Kendall died, and clear water was filling it up instead.

Zich walked over to Gren.

“Are you okay?”

“Yeah, that’s fine.” Gren got up. There was no sign of discomfort as he had already finished treatment with potions. But still worried, Lara supported him.

“You knocked them down by yourself.”

“How was it possible?”

“I’m sorry I couldn’t help.”

Gren apologized. Zich looked at Gren closely as he spoke modestly. Are you serious? Or is it just a mask?

I couldn't tell just by looking at his face.

Gren looked at Kendell, who was lying around.

“Are you trying to revive the dead? No matter how deep the love, it is impossible. It's also something that shouldn't happen. The dead never come back alive.”

At first glance, it sounds like the right thing to say. That's not what Zich, who initially admits to all other ideas, has to say. But if his actions contradict his remarks, it's a different story.

' I?'

Before returning, Zich was apparently dead. However, through the miraculous phenomenon of regression, they were given a new life, and they were given youth and new possibilities.

In a way, it's a bigger phenomenon than the resurrection of the dead.

And Gren is the one Zich suspects he's been doing.

'This guy may be more trash than I thought.'

Someone who thinks of themselves as garbage, who is garbage among garbage. It's garbage that just makes you feel dizzy just thinking about it.

“By the way, Mr. Zeek.”

Gren looked at Kendall's corpse with a pitiful gaze and opened his mouth to look at Zich. It didn't seem like it would be a very pleasant topic to talk about with a bad voice.

“Did you really have to ridicule Mr. Isid like that? It must have already been won.”

Zich shrugged.

“I didn't have to do that. It was just something I wanted to do.”

“•••It is not a good hobby.”

“Isn’t it okay if you like yourself as a hobby? As long as you don't harm others, it's up to you to do whatever you like."

“Is that mocking someone about to die?”

“I didn’t think that his sin was light enough to be forgiven for taking his life. Perhaps the victim or those involved would have been very happy to see what I did. Isn't it?”

The atmosphere around you goes down. After the battle, the fight between the leaders of the two groups made the atmosphere of the others awkward.

At that moment, a large number of footsteps began to be heard from the aisle. The sound of splashing on the water gets closer and closer.

Zich took his eyes off Gren's face and looked at the passageway.

“It looks like the reinforcements have arrived.”

It's a little late, but Zich didn't care. Because of that, I was able to decorate Kendell's last road with beautiful thorns.

Zich turned his head to Gren again. Gren was still looking at Zich with a defiant look.

Zich patted Gren on the shoulder.

“We are very different from each other. Well, what you've known for a long time is nothing new to you. Just don't care about each other and let's go our own way. I accept your thoughts as well.”

And Zich turned his back. I had to explain the situation to the reinforcements who came running.

But before Zich could step away, he heard a word from Ren.

“What if I can’t accept your thoughts?”

The tension between the two groups was tightened for an instant.

Hans puts his hand on Estelaide's sword hilt, and Snok concentrates on the ground he is resting on.

Laila looked at the situation with cold eyes. Lara and Elena looked at people's eyes with tension.

puck puck

Zich stepped towards Gren. Slowly he moves. People's tense gaze followed Zich's movement.

puck puck

Zich stopped right in front of Gren. Even though he didn't raise a weapon, even a slight stimulus seemed to cause a sword fight.

Zich, who was staring at Gren, smiled.

“My thoughts and the thoughts of others collide. And I can't accept the other person's opinion. Then there are two ways that come to mind right now. One is persuasion. This is a gentle way to end the situation. But I'm not going to fall for your persuasion. Then there is only one way left.”

Zich reached out in front of Gren, and slowly clenched his fingers to form a fist.

"strength."

Jack's smile disappeared.

“If you do not want to acknowledge my thoughts and do not like what I do, that is the only way I can stop it.”

"•••I see. Next time something like this happens, I will always remember your advice.”

For a moment, the eyes diverge. Zich smiled again.

“I hope my advice helps

good.”

And this time Zich turned his back and approached the reinforcements. Zich's group followed him.

Gren stayed there and looked at Zich's back as he moved away.

Thus, the serial disappearance of lovers in Zanmalfi came to an end.

(Continued on next page)

The culprit in the serial disappearance of Janmalfi has been caught.

The rumor spread quickly throughout Zanmalfi. All the citizens were overjoyed when the reason for literally throwing the entertainment business of Janmalfi into the mud was gone.

Of course, the officials of the missing persons were greatly saddened. They did not give up hope and hoped for the safe return of the missing, but in the end, their families, lovers, and friends returned as cold corpses.

Seeing the coffins coming out of the casino one by one, the families who had heard the news cried out.

Some even cried and fainted. There were even those who cursed the criminal and demanded Kendell's body in order to disgrace even the body.

However, their grief could not affect everyone in the city, and Janmalfi soon stabilized rapidly.

Again, people went out, and the laughter of lovers blossomed. The entertainment business will gradually recover to its former level.

When the case was resolved, the lord was very happy and gave a large amount of rewards to the parties involved in the resolution of the case.

It was also intended to spread the fact that the case was resolved at a faster rate.

After the grand award ceremony, the party returned to their dormitory. And this time, a small party was held with the party.

For a party in which the Earl and Marquis Young-ae of a single country participated, food was placed on the table, which was too trivial, and people clashed with glasses filled with their own wishes.

“Huh, now I feel that the case is completely over.”

Johaim, who drank the strong alcohol at once, exhaled with a sigh. Jack replied.

“You seem to have suffered quite a bit.”

“It has to be. Even after investigating the case, no clues came out, and the number of victims continued to increase. I was worried about the kidnapped people, and I couldn't sleep well because I thought that there would be more victims in the future. Besides, personally, it was also an incident where the fate of my family was at stake.” Johaim trembled as he remembered the feelings of that time.

“I was really glad that Zich came.”

“Then is the family okay?”

“I was about to fall on the edge of the cliff, but I was barely able to focus. Yes, it definitely puts my breath away.”

A ray of light is beginning to appear in the foggy future. It was a satisfactory situation for Joachim.

“Now, based on this, we have to slowly climb up.”

And I will put the name of Dracula on the rock again.

“The fact that the perpetrator's skills were surprisingly great also had a positive effect on the evaluation. But it's not just about liking the victims.”

If it had been just an ordinary disappearance case, there would not have been so many victims. Joachim's voice grew heavy.

Evelynn comforted Joachim.

“Don’t blame yourself like that, Count. The Count did his best enough. Besides, the case has definitely been resolved.”

“Honestly, it also comes down to my conscience. This time, from number one to ten, Zich-sama solved it.”

Lyla denied him.

“You don't have to think that way. Originally, the job of people in high positions is to recruit talented people and place them in suitable positions. If it wasn't for the Count, we wouldn't have been able to hire Zich and push him out of the way. Then, obviously, the case would have dragged on a little longer. Isn't that right, Zich?"

"right."

If it had not been for the full support of Joheim, who was in charge of the case when solving this case, Sieg would not have been able to solve the case so easily.

Most of all, didn't you give me the information that there is something related to the robes in this city?

'In the end, I couldn't find the robes.'

While investigating the case, the robes also searched, but not a single hem of the robes was found.

'Perhaps it's moved since I've finished the work necessary to turn Kendell Ysiid into a Demon. Or I left the rest to Gren Gennard.'

Anyway, the mere fact of fucking the robes alone was enough to help Yoheim.

“Mr. Lyla is right. And in fact, I am the one who has been the least helpful here.”

“It’s not so, young Rouge. Young-ae's ideas did not help much in resolving the case."

In the first place, she came up with the idea of ​​having the party impersonate a lover to bring out the criminal.

And thanks to that, I was able to see Kendell's shadow for the first time.

“Do you really think so?”

"exactly."

“Then I don’t think the Count needs to bear the burden of his heart.”

Evelynn smiles softly. He was taken aback by her words for a moment, and Yo-Ha-Im also smiled dejectedly and affirmed her words.

“Surely it is. After admitting that Young Ae Rouge was helpful, I shouldn't consider myself useless."

"Yes? Then this talk is over.”

As if one thing had been resolved, she clapped her hands once and said, 'Fuck!' hit and got a drink. Her cup was already empty.

“Then let’s have another drink!”

After refilling the glass, the party clashed once more.

After that, a lot of chatter came and went.

The topics are several. Amidst the small talk, Evelynn looked at the corner of the table.

“Um, did you say Mr. Dwayne?”

"Yes Yes'?"

Elena was startled when her name suddenly appeared.

“You look a little uneasy, is there something wrong with you?”

Actually, she didn't say much.

I wondered if it was because of Joachim's or Evelynn's status, but it didn't seem to be the case. She was glancing at someone's eyes.

“I think he was watching Zich-san.”

Elena shook her head. She immediately looks into Zich's eyes. Is there something wrong with Zich?

It was Lyla who answered.

“It’s nothing. Do you know how filthy Zeek is?”

“What…”

Evelynn was speechless.

“That kind of Zich used all means to harass this criminal. And Elena saw it for the first time.”

In addition to Elena, Joachim's gaze turned to Zich.

What the hell did he do to make Elena look at him? I wanted to know, but I didn't want to know at the same time.

“Time will fix this. Even Snake or Snock thinks so now.”

Hans and Snock, who had already become accustomed to Sieg's personality, did not show much reaction to this.

Of course, this bullying on Kendall was so great that it was considered the best of all the bullies they saw of Zich, but there was already a perception that Sieg could do it.

Of course, it wasn't that he didn't understand Elena's feelings. Elena made the start too grand.

“Elena, don’t be too afraid. This guy is harmless as long as he doesn't cross the line he has set.

Hey."

Lyla reached out and stretched Zich's cheek.

“Mmm, hey.”

Zich lets out a muffled voice. But he wasn't angry or anything like that.

If I had to categorize it, it would seem that it was a bit crazy.

Seeing that, Elena without realizing it, said, 'Hey!' burst into laughter.

“Yeah, that’s it. You won't get used to it right away, but at least you don't have to be too scared."

Lyla placed her cheek on Zich. After rubbing her red cheeks several times, Zich's hand pulled Lyla's cheek.

This time, squashed voices leaked out of Lila's mouth.

There is a pleasant atmosphere all around. And inside, there was also Elena, who was still looking at Zich, but burst into laughter again.

Such a small party gradually ripened.

Sieg and his party did not leave Zanmalfi right away. Didn't they come here to play in the first place?

The existence of Kendell Isid was completely unexpected to them.

There was also a feeling of fatigue after solving one case, so they enjoyed Zanmalfi's entertainment fervently. Needless to say, the number of tourists lost due to the incident has not yet recovered, so they can enjoy their entertainment more comfortably.

But not everyone in the party was just playing.

Zich was lazing around in the city quarters. Hans, Snock, and Elena go out to the city to play.

Someone knocked on the door and then swung it open.

There is only one person who dares to enter Zich's room like this.

“It’s very sloppy.” Lyla entered the room with a thick book in her arms.

Lying on the bed with his arms drooping, Zich, who was like dried mud on a rock, raised his hand.

"I'm here?"

“Any other kids?”

“I went to play.”

“You didn’t go?”

“No matter how good it was, I got tired of playing. After all, I can't keep up with the stamina of the young guys."

“You seem to have the stamina to spit out nonsense.”

Lyla slumped into her chair and placed a thick book on the tabletop.

“It’s better. Come and help me with this.”

“I am taking a break. My stamina depends.”

“If you say bullshit once, it can be considered a joke, but from the second time on, it’s just annoying.”

Zich got up, scratching his head, and trudged over to sit across from Lyla.

If anyone saw him, he looked like an unemployed person who didn't work and made food or livestock in the house.

“What are you doing?”

"Cloone's Character Interpretation."

Zich's eyes twinkled. If so, it was interesting enough.

“What can I do to help?”

“Mark the pages with sentences with these characters.”

Lyla handed him a note with some of Cloone's texts on it.

simple labor. I don't like it very much. But it will definitely be necessary. And if you help yourself, you can get into Claw One's reality more quickly.

Zich meekly took the thick book Lyla was offering and opened it.

A feast of incomprehensible texts fills the page. Zich began to scan the page slowly, looking at the note Leila had handed him.

“Are there any results?”

"Not yet."

“Isn’t it difficult for even Laila under heaven to interpret texts that she knows nothing about?”

“No, we have all the minimum data for interpretation. It's difficult, but it's not impossible. However, there was not enough time.” Lila sighed a little.

“Actually, I was going to focus on the interpretation of the text while Elena was making up her mind in this city.”

“But is it that the plan has gone awry with Ishid’s appearance?”

"right."

Lyla took her eyes off the book and looked at Zich.

“What do you mean, but how about staying in this city for a while? To be honest, I want to take the time to decipher the text.”

"I do not care."

Finding out the identity of Cloone, which is thought to be the first step in discovering his return, Gren's identity, and the identity of the robes, is one of Zich's greatest goals now. There is no need to insist on moving to another city just to stay to find the clue.

There will be other things to do in this city that are good, too.

So Zich gladly accepted Lyla's offer, and the party decided to stay here in Janmalfi for a while.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 310 screen

Hans was walking alone on the road. When we came out, we were together with Snock and Elena, but now we are acting separately.

'If I'm with those guys, I can see something.'

It was like an older brother who didn't even notice at all on a date with his lover.

Of course, it wasn't that the two noticed something, nor that they quickly fell in love and became lovers.

But when the three of them got together, it seemed like Hans himself was acting out.

'There is something special between the two of them.'

Apparently, he had a relationship with Elena by helping her study magic, so Elena had a tendency to be very comfortable with Snok.

Whether she was a fallen genius who was only absorbed in studying magic, the reason was that she was the first friend she made.

Therefore, even if the three of them came out of the dorm, Hans soon had more time to go out alone and explore the city.

'I feel a little pitiful.'

I feel like I've lost something to my dear brother.

So Hans ran through the tattered city. Even if I was alone, Zanmalfi was very faithful to entertainment, so I had a lot of things to play alone.

Hans was not discouraged by the fact that he was alone and enjoyed the city to the fullest.

'If it is judged that sufficient rest time has been given, Zich-sama will resume training without mercy.'

Hans was sure.

As he walked through the city alone, his footsteps stopped at some point.

'here is...'

a familiar place The space that had just been filled with buildings suddenly opened up.

It is one of the streams that run through the city. Several bridges line the creek.

'It must be where I met Mr. Browning.'

Hans looked subconsciously over the bridge where he had met her before.

' Huh?'

As if she had turned back time, she saw Lara standing on the bridge just as she had seen before.

Hans approached her, thinking that it would be a good idea to say hello to her since they don't know each other.

It was time for him to talk. Lara shuddered and turned around, putting her hand on the hilt of the sword.

Hans laughed involuntarily. Because it was the same situation that happened when I met Lara a while ago.

Just like before, take a step back and lightly

raised both hands.

"who...."

Her vigilant eyes sank as soon as she saw Hans. Hans said as he raised his hand.

“Hello, Mr Browning. We met again in the same situation.”

"Ah...!"

Lara, who looked at her hand on the hilt of the sword, quickly straightened her posture.

“Sorry, I’m sorry.”

"No, thanks. I can understand why you are overreacting so much.”

Since there is Laila, who can be called the ultimate beauty queen, in the party, how annoying she is usually can be expected.

And even more so when you're alone.

Hans looked around. Beyond the railing of the bridge, a rippling creek and bridges can be seen.

“You seem to like this place. I have seen you here before.”

“The view is open along the creek. It feels like it's going to explode.”

Hans and Lara naturally leaned on the railing next to each other and talked.

To have a conversation comfortably, you need to have a common topic. It was natural that the topic of discussion between the two ended up in the case of Kendell, which happened a while ago.

“Are you okay, Mr. Jennard? I think he was injured then.”

“I wasn't seriously injured. I just lost my mind for a moment from the shock. I also treated the injured area with potions.”

“I’m happy.”

“Are Hans and his party okay?”

“Yes, everyone is safe.”

“I’m happy with that too.” That's how we greet each other. And the story of the incident continued. As a result, it was impossible not to come up with a story about one person.

it was big

From the moment Zich became a topic of discussion, an awkward atmosphere began to flow between the two.

“Honestly, I can’t believe that man is Carwiman’s honorary paladin.”

Hans smiled bitterly at Lara's words. As for Sieg's personality, even Hans, who respected him, could not take the side.

'Ziek himself doesn't want it either.'

Even if Hans had covered Zich because he had a good personality, he would have come forward and asked, 'Are your eyes twisted?' It was good to bet.

“It is a title obtained through the subjugation of Valid and the protection of the saint. He is clearly far from the paladin that people think of.”

“It’s my personality, but it’s also the case when I push Kendell Isid.”

At that time, she was busy blocking Kendell's men with Zich's party, but she could still hear Zich's voice to some extent.

In particular, I can hear Kendell's conversation after he was mortally wounded.

In addition, after the incident was over, Gren heard about the situation, so she knew most of what happened between Sieg and Kendell in the cavity.

“Obviously, Kendell Isid is a wicked man who deserves judgment. Even if there is a story, that does not mean that sins can be forgiven.”

Lara admitted that.

“But what he did was over the top! Considering the circumstances at that time, to be honest, you don't even know who the villain is!"

'Ziek is not a villain.'

However, if asked which side of the character was more rotten and damaged, Hans would cautiously vote for Zich.

And when I asked him if his behavior was similar to that of a villain, he had nothing to say.

But that's it.

“I admit that Ziek's behavior can be overstated in the eyes of others. Zich's personality is also very dirty. But nonetheless, Zeek-sama is not a villain.”

Without a single word of shame, Hans asserts.

“The opponent Zich-sama is harassing is limited to the villain. He never bothers good people who stand still. Rather, you try to save them from the villains.”

“•••I admit that. But it's also true that the person's personality is twisted. What if that person turns into a villain? It's not unusual for someone with that twist to become a villain... .”

“I will stop it.”

“… Yes?"

Lara looked at him in surprise at the unexpected answer.

“If that happens, I will stop Zich-sama. Even risk your life.”

As Hans said that, his eyes didn't show a single word wavering.

“No, given Zich-sama’s power, I don’t see the slightest possibility of stopping him without risking his life. I'll stop it though. And that is also the teaching of Zich-sama.”

“… You said that person taught you that'?”

"That's right. He is the one who firmly supports my immature dream of becoming a warrior. So, don't hesitate to say that. If he himself turns into a villain, he tells him not to hesitate, but to point his sword at the tip of his sword.”

I wonder if Zich is even teaching Hans by saying such things, and Lara

couldn't find anything to say.

Silence passed. Hans found no need to stay here any longer. He turned to leave.

“Oh, and Bonnie, did I tell you before? Zeek-sama acknowledged your sword talent.”

Then I saw that In a way, he wasn't the only person who recently praised her sword talent.

“If you want to keep using the sword, it's good to push it as you please. Because Zich-sama is much stronger than your party.”

I feel Lara crying. Presumably, using Gren as a comparison object seems to have touched his heart. But Hans didn't care and turned his back.

* * *

“You broke up like that?”

Lila asked curiously. Hans, who had his head bowed down as if he had committed a crime, nodded. I thought.

'How did this happen?' After a bit of a conflict with Lara, he turned around coolly, but when he thought about it again, he realized that he was doing too much.

Although Hans showed no mercy toward his enemies after being stained by Zich, he was unable to do so to others.

So, when I entered the dorm, I was feeling quite depressed, but it was caught by Laila.

Lyla led Ojirya and dragged Hans into Zich's room. If you have any concerns, you are willing to listen. Of course, there was also very little desire to relieve the stress of Clawone's text interpretation with other people's stories.

“Why did you say that?”

“•••I was a little moved by the insulting comments from Ziek... .”

“You did something useless. There is nothing wrong with what he said.”

'Isn't it?' asked Lyla looking back. Zich, who was lying on the bed a little further away, waved his hand and said.

“Well, you were right.”

“I know that too.”

“What is it?”

As Zich raised his torso, Hans dragged the chair back and back. It was a reflex action derived from Zich's hard rolls so far.

Fortunately, Zich only waved his fists, but didn't pose a direct threat.

Also, Lyla told her to be quiet and threw the pillow next to her, and she lay flat again.

Lyla urged Hans to keep talking. Hans also looked at Zich and opened his mouth again.

“Obviously, if you look at it from the other person’s point of view, it’s understandable, but it’s still gossip about Zich-sama, isn’t it? Thinking like that, I got a little angry.”

“Actually, even if you call me a bastard, we have to do it, because it’s unpleasant if others do it.”

“Hey, that’s not comforting.”

Zich, who was spinning the pillow that Lyla had thrown, giggled as he said that. Lyla ignored it.

“So you brought up the name of Ren Gennard, which she seems to like?”

"Yes. And to be honest, I wasn't wrong either."

“It is.”

If Lyla had to trust either one of Zich or Gren when talking about her talent, of course she would trust Zich.

None of the futures she knew of had Gren Gennard personally outperformed Zich.

'When it comes to strength and talent, no one is more accurate than Zeek.'

Besides, doesn't Zich have the knowledge of the future like Laila herself?

“That’s right.”

He threw the pillow that Zich was spinning on the bed, got up and sat on the rest of the chair.

“After all, even Lara Browning told an unpleasant truth. And you were just telling the truth. That might offend Lara Browning, but that's what she did first."

“… You are great too.”

To tell the truth of Lara's insults to Zich without hesitation.

The great thing about Zich is his magic power, talent, personality, and so on, but perhaps the most important of them all is his brazenness, Lyla thought.

“But what are you worried about? I know your personality well, but I thought you were a little overly concerned. Did your heart shrank because you said harsh words to the person you like?”

Zich booed, but Hans shook his head. I had no such thought.

“At the end of the day, if you keep using your sword, didn’t you tell me to push it out as you please? And then I provoked her. I'm worried that I'll let go of the sword because of repulsion. He seemed to have a lot of trouble.”

Such concerns were not expected. Zich and Lyla looked at each other and blinked.

“… You're buying me to worry anyway."

“It’s still nice, isn’t it? It is terrifying to think that there are only people like you, Sieg.”

“I’m a little ahead of my perfection, for people to catch up.”

Ignoring Laila, who was looking at him with pitiful eyes, Zich turned his eyes to Hans.

“Don’t worry about anything. If he would throw away his sword with just that level of provocation, he would have thrown away his sword even if you didn’t say that.”

"However… .”

"Besides, you're not saying you're wrong."

Zick said arrogantly.

"Because it's true that I'm much better than Gren Jennard."

Hans laughed bitterly.

“But if you still have concerns, I will take care of you.”

“How do you mean?”

“Worry is something you can do because you can afford it. If you train so thoroughly that you don't think about it, other people's worries... .”

“No more worries!”

Hans jumped up and shouted.

Zich nodded as if he liked the look. And Lila quietly shook her head.

Glenn glanced back. A wall of fine blood blocks his view. His eyes narrowed.

'Damn it!'

spit swearing inside He came to this city to raise his too low reputation, but everything was messed up.

Of course, the intended purpose of gaining fame was achieved. The problem was that the achieved reputation was too low than expected.

Kendell was truly a stealthy mover. He thoroughly hid himself in case it would interfere with the purpose of resurrecting his lover.

Because he loved his lover too much, his jealousy turned toward other lovers, and the case changed from a case of indiscriminate disappearance to a case of missing lover, which made it possible to identify the victim. Excellent.

Originally, Janmalfi was swung around by such a Kundel, but in the end, he couldn't catch the culprit. And in Janmalfi, a new mine with a resurrected lover is born.

'It doesn't last long.'

Kendell Isidran Main was a goal sitter. Even if you resurrect your lover, you will soon realize that it is not your lover who resurrected you. Gren's words to Kendell were not unfounded. After that, I usually went down two paths.

Either you become a true demon who runs away and destroys everything around you, or kills yourself.

'He's an extremely unstable guy.'

Unlike other demons who usually walk on a well-designed path, the possibility of not becoming a magician increases significantly with just a few occasions.

If we hadn't secured enough humans to become Mine, we would not have left Kundel Isid as a Mine candidate.

But there were already enough demons to disrupt the world and make him famous, so he left the restless ones like Kendall alone.

Often in this early stage, he used it as a sacrifice for his own fame.

But this time, the case turned out to be extraordinary.

Although it is unsettling, the person who could grow as a Magician died, and Gren only gained a very small reputation.

And the one who stole that fame is his greatest goal.

'Siegmore!'

Sparks flew from Gren's eyes. A name that makes your teeth gnaw just by calling you inside.

'He messed everything up!'

Zich, who was supposed to be the Demon King, became a hero of the city, and Yohai Im and Evelynn, who had to plunge the world into fear and despair as his subordinates, rather helped Zich to save the city.

I pretended that Zich was going to take down Kendell and made Shia attack him, but it was a defeat.

'Using the Sia Rubrenter to defeat him... .'

As for battle, he was unparalleled.

A fate that is so wrong. I swear never before.

'It must be because of Siegmore.'

I was very surprised when he told me that he had become an honorary paladin of Carwiman.

But that was only the beginning. From that point on, the whole plan went awry.

'I have to find him too.'

The most likely suspect who created this absurd situation.

'That motherfucker who taught Siegmore weird things!'

I did not know that someone who could twist fate to this extent would only appear now.

I don't know who he is or what motivated him to lead him to Zich, but I had to find him.

'Even for the next one!'

Even at that time, so that fate would not be twisted like this.

But it wasn't all bad.

'Did I say Lila?'

A wizard that Zich takes as a companion.

'It was great.'

Both her beauty and her skills were truly worthy of being a warrior's companion. I was very excited to think that Elena was stolen from me, but a higher-level compatibility with her came out.

'If she were not Elena's reserve, she might be able to push Elena into the reserve.'

Among the members of the perfect champion party in his head, Elena's name dropped, and Lyla's name was added to it.

'Okay, I'm going to tell him to find out about Lyla. Besides, given this time, I would have found out to some extent the identity of the guy who gave Siegmore advice.'

At least you should have gotten a clue.

'I'll see you after a long time.'

His next destination was decided.

'But then I have to drop this guy first.'

Gren glanced at Lara. Not long ago, she had been troubled by something. In a way, he seemed to feel guilty. I asked the reason, but she faltered and didn't answer.

'••• You still have no intention of raising a shield.'

His gaze scans the sword hanging from Lara's waist with displeasure.

'In the past, around this time, I threw away the sword and focused on the shield.'

A damn twisted fate must have been affecting her as well.

'••• I don't need Lara Browning without a shield.'

I just lost my attention for nothing. He had to be the only one who used the sword at the party.

'Let's try to convince him a little bit more. Because Lara's skills are  very good.' But if she doesn't give up in the end... .

'I don't need to carry it anymore.'

There are spare parts. It's a little inferior to Lara, but at least it will be much more useful than Lara now.

Gren looked back again. You can see the walls of Zanmalfi farther away than before. Beyond that wall, he will still be there.

'I can't keep Siegmore installed.'

If you go on like this, you may continue to lose the cheers and applause you deserve.

There are no clear plans yet. For now, he's just blaming Kendell's process and arguing with Zich, creating a little room where it won't be strange if a conflict occurs later.

Whether to save it or just leave it as a mere disagreement will depend on the situation going forward.

'Just follow your destiny, Siegmore. Don't try to pretend to be a hero of justice. Because you're not a Zich Brave.'

Fortunately, there was no chance that Zeeg would become a Brave, and that alone was a good thing for Gren.

Zich and the others decided to stay in Zanmalfi for a while to interpret the Cloone characters. As a city famous for its entertainment, you might think you'll enjoy your stay in Zanmalpi. However, Hans and Snock were already prepared. No matter how nice this city is, it won't be a paradise for them to the end. As expected, Zich began to train the two of them again after some time had passed.

Elena was also there. As Laila concentrated on interpreting the characters, naturally, the time for magic class had to be reduced. Zich made a fantastic use of that spare time. Even a magician must have basic physical strength and thoroughly rolled her.

As a result, she could very clearly see what hell Hans and Snock had tasted and suffered under Zich.

“Come on, run more! No matter how much a wizard, if he stays in a room, his head will become stiff! You from Dwayne wouldn't know!"

Elena, who was running with traces of saliva and vomit that could not be wiped off, almost screamed in an instant.

As Sieg said, basic exercise is recommended even in the horse tower. However, it was only to the extent that it was helpful to the study of magic, and it was absolutely not such an ignorant exercise.

“That’s what your master did too! Are you going to quit!”

Of course, Zich did not want the level of Lyla. Because, surprisingly, Laila also had considerable physical abilities. However, Elena's physical abilities were mediocre.

But Zich's words worked for Elena. That too for sure.

Elena's eyes, which had been released, returned to focus. Cleaving her teeth, she started moving her legs again.

“Yeah, that’s it! Good job, Elena!”

Zich shouted loudly towards his back.

'This should be enough.'

Although he was pushing Elena quite a bit, Zich had no intention of continuing this intensity of training. She's not the type of person who fights with her body, and she's not the kind of person who can be called a disciple like Hans or Snock.

'Still, you must have some degree of physical ability.'

In order to travel with Zich and his party, even a wizard must have basic stamina. That's good for battle too. Especially for those who put their heads on dangerous things like Zich and his friends.

'Main, Demon King, Cloone, and even Gurren Jennerd.'

Each one is unusual. No matter how great Zeeg himself was, there was no guarantee that he could continue to protect them against them. Therefore, this basic training was natural.

But Zich didn't worry more than necessary.

'Because he must have come prepared for the fact that he might fall into a difficult situation anyway.'

Before taking on Elena, she and her grandfather had already received the answer.

Most of all, isn't she that Elena Dwayne? Knowing how much of a monstrous wizard she would become when she grew up, Zich didn't feel any danger.

'Is your opponent Mine? Elena Dwayne was on a team that specialized in subjugating those mines.'

Although she went around in a party, her power was equal to or greater than that of a Magician, especially the highest grade Demon.

'Maybe I will become a more magical wizard than before the return'

Considering her talent, Lyla, the best teacher, and the experiences she will have in the future, it's not even an idea. Rather, it is highly probable that

'Before that, this hard training is necessary to prevent breaking.'

Of course, the hard training you do for the first time in your life

Rather, it can gnaw at the body, but it is enough to treat it with a potion. It's an ignorant method, but nothing is more certain than this.

To my surprise, unlike the sadistic appearance of Elena's thorough roll, what is now moving Sieg is pure favor with no calculations whatsoever. A really rare act for Zich.

Of course, Elena couldn't afford to think about that. He just dyed his hair white and was running like crazy.

'When Lyla is immersed in character interpretation and has some free time to study magic, it should be up to a certain level.'

After that, you will only need to train enough to maintain the physical abilities you raised.

Zich looked at Elena who was running again after taking the target. She looked at Zich and then turned to the side.

Startle!

she trembled

where she sees There were images of Hans and Snock undergoing training that was not comparable to her training.

“Don’t do it right!”

When Zich shouted, Hans and Snock straightened their slack position. Seeing that, Zich looked at Elena this time.

“Aren’t you running fast?”

Elena gave strength to her legs.

The training continued until the sun went down, and when they returned to their dorms, the three were completely super-dead.

* * *

That evening, Zich and his party were having a meal with Yoheim and Evelynn after a long time. The two were still in the city.

“Aren’t the others involved?”

asked Joachim.

There were only Zich, Lyla, Yo Haim, and Evelynn at the dinner table. The disciples were nowhere to be seen.

“I trained hard today, and I was stretched out. After all, they are weak guys.”

"Is that so?"

I wondered if it was Joheim and Iblin, who didn't know about Zich's training. It was Laila, wishing luck to the three of them who were lying on the bed and sleeping like they were dead.

Some time to eat and chat a little. It was about time to see a lot of empty space on the plate.

“I’m sorry, Zich, could you please grant me a favor?”

Joachim opened his mouth.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 312 screen

“Anything to ask?”

"That's right."

Joheim's face stiffened slightly, as if it had been so long since he had received Zich's help that he was so pathetic that he asked for help again.

Seeing that, Zich smirked inwardly.

'That's right, it's funny to look at it like this again.'

Before his return, he followed him and said blatant remarks, but now he has become a full-fledged count of a kingdom and feels shame for his incompetence.

Of course, that yoheim and this yoheim are different. Zich didn't mean to confuse that. But I didn't mean to treat them like they were completely strangers.

'It's not the Yoheim and Evelynn I know, but it's clear that these guys are their past.'

For that reason alone, my heart goes to them. I couldn't find any reason to deny it either. And because of that, Kendell suffered a very tragic death.

“Let’s listen.”

That's what he said, but if it wasn't difficult, Zich was going to grant the request.

“In a nutshell, it’s about eradicating bandits.”

“A band of thieves?”

"That's right."

“Would you like to hear more details?”

Here's what Joachim said:

After resolving this case, it is said that Baek, who ruled the entire area, including Zanmalfi, was very happy.

I heard that it will help a lot in restoring the honor of Dracul's estate in the future. It was something that Joachim did not wish for.

And after a while, the Count brought an offer. He said that if it succeeded, it would be possible to bring back the honor of Joheim a little.

“Is that the extermination of the bandits?”

"Yes. Next to this Count is the Marquis. The Marquis of Campbell.”

Concentrating on the story, Joheim had completely put down the dishes. On the other hand, Zich emptied the leftover food.

“Marquis Campbell is a very influential person in the kingdom.”

“That means he is someone who can help Count Dracule a lot.”

“It is correct.”

Joheim nodded.

“It is said that bandits are boiling in the Marquis of Campbell right now.”

Zich tilted his head.

“Did the Marquis ask for help because of the bandits?”

"That's right."

“The size of the group must be considerable. If it’s to the point where he can’t handle it on his own.”

“It is not. I don't know the exact size yet, but it won't be big enough to overturn at least one estate."

“You still need help?”

A high-ranking noble called the Marquis could only rant at a thief who wasn't very big. It was a word I did not readily understand.

“First of all, it is said that the Marquis Order itself does not have much power right now. The Marquis is the one who guards the border with the neighboring country that is not on good terms. In fact, it was a country that even went to war a decade ago.”

I felt a little offended when I mentioned that Joachim didn't feel very good about the country.

“So we have to keep a certain number of troops on the border. Of course, that alone does not make it difficult for bandits, but now the Marquis is fighting pirates.”

“Are you talking about pirates?”

“It is said that a small group of pirates started to form a coalition not long ago and grew into a force that cannot be ignored. So, I put a lot of effort into preparing and started clearing the pirates.”

“In other words, the thieves are in trouble when they are working hard to defeat the grown pirates, and they also have to leave the troops to check the neighboring kingdom.”

"That's right."

No matter how great the title of marquis is, it is certain that it is a troublesome situation.

“Of course, that would have ended up being just a headache.”

“There is something more.”

“The place where the bandits are active is near the city of Bembice. It is one of the largest cities in the Marquis Territory and is large enough for the whole country. It is also an important point of transportation for Colonel Hu.”

“The thieves have a swollen liver. No, in this case, is it a good idea?”

As long as he clearly understands the situation of the Marquis and runs rampant, it's not that clever.

At least, it means that there are definitely more mind-blowing thieves out there than in the world.

“I still don’t know who they are. Are they really smart guys who can accurately recognize the status quo and try to get the most out of the Marquis's gap, or are they just lucky guys.”

Even if the band of thieves is the latter, we cannot underestimate them.

Zich didn't want to deny that luck is as important as skill in navigating this world.

'Because this case might increase the power even more.'

If you establish a base in a major transportation hub and attack people, you will receive an income that is different from living loudly in a sparsely populated outskirts.

In addition, Joheim's subsequent words added to the seriousness of the situation.

“And as it is a major transportation hub, most of the goods move to Bembis. Even the military supplies to fight pirates this time.”

“•••If that's the case, it's not at the level of thinking that just a gang of thieves is running rampant.”

If the movement of military supplies is delayed due to the influence of bandits and the pirates fail, the honor of the Marquis Combell will fall to the ground along with the damage of the Marquis.

“Now I understand. That's enough to call for help from the neighboring estates.”

“Besides, the present count’s wife is also the marquis’ younger sister, so it would have been easier to reach out.”

Are you tied up by kinship? It was understandable enough.

“So the Count is sending reinforcements to the Marquis?”

“It is not. The Marquis didn't even ask for it like that. In fact, it is said that they have their own troops to defeat the bandits.”

“Then what kind of help do you need?”

“You want someone who can find a stronghold for thieves.”

“It looks like you haven’t found it.”

The most troublesome thing about dealing with bandits is finding their base.

Normally, when the regular army is dispatched, any robbers can be dealt with. However, that was the story when the thieves were rightly attached to the front.

'But the thieves can't fight head-on.'

Usually, thieves are frightened when regular troops arrive and often lock themselves in their hiding places or run away.

Therefore, the success or failure of thieves subjugation depends on the performance of pursuit and search rather than combat power.

"That's right. However, it is said that the Marquis is very worried because it is a state in which it is impossible to search all around the city by recruiting troops on a large scale now that we are focusing on the vigilance of the enemy and the subjugation of pirates.”

“So, did you get a request?”

“It seems that the Count was quite impressed before the Kendell Isid subjugation. My army couldn't even catch the criminal's shadow properly, but we solved the case fairly quickly. And it’s mostly Zeek-nim’s work.”

“Hmm, then my job will be to find the thieves’ bases near Bembice.”

"That's right."

"great. Let me take over.”

Without much thought, Zich readily agreed. Joachim's face brightened.

"Thank you very much. I get a lot of grace from Zich-nim.”

“You can pay interest later and return it generously.”

"Hahaha! I will  pay you back later .” Joheim chuckled.

“But this time, I plan to go alone. Please understand that.”

People looked at Zich with surprised eyes. In particular, Laila was even more surprised as she thought of packing her luggage as soon as she returned to her room without much thought.

"what? Why all of a sudden?"

Her voice expressed her feelings. But Zich still spoke bluntly.

“Didn’t you decide to stay here for a while because of your work?”

It's called Cloone's interpretation of text.

“I can’t afford to have to move again and disrupt your work. The result is something I am very much looking forward to.”

Also, she felt regretful because the interpretation time seemed to be shortening, and she was happy with Siek's words.

“But why are you alone? Aren't you going to take the other kids with you?"

“Helena, I don’t want to leave your side. Since the party is divided like that, it is better for me to go alone and deal with it quickly. From what I've heard, it doesn't seem like a lot of people are needed .  Rather, it is a hindrance.”

If you run around the city with your sense of humor wide open, you'll get caught.

With that in mind, the rest who haven't been able to keep up with Zich's speed are a hindrance. However, Hans and Snock's sense of humor is not as wide as Zich's.

“Just let the two of you hang out here. You will probably like it.”

“It is.”

It's not that Zich hasn't given him free time so far, but there's no greater freedom than the absence of a fearful watcher.

At this point, Zich decided to completely release the two of them once.

"great. I'll diligently interpret it while you're away."

Lyla also agreed with Zich. Zich looked at Yohaim.

“Now that it has come to pass, please report that I am the only Won-gun.”

"all right."

To be honest, I was a little nervous about going alone, but Yoheim quickly erased that thought.

After all, he knew that the most judgmental person in Zich's group was Zich.

So it was decided that Zeek alone would depart from the Count Campbell's post command.

After the meal, Joachim and Evelynn were riding in a wagon to the dormitory where Joheim was staying.

Evelynn's lodgings were in the same place as Zich's, so she didn't have to ride the wagon, but she often enjoys a brief conversation with Joachim on the day Joachim visits.

It was not strange that two people who recognized each other anew in the midst of a big event naturally became close.

And that feeling developed little by little, to the point where they talked to each other in the carriage.

Joachim looked at Evelynn who was sitting across from him. She sighed, wrinkling her forehead.

“Ha, really, there is no progress between the two of them.”

Knowing her worries, Yohaim smiled bitterly. After talking to her recently, I got to know what kind of person she is.

“Isn’t that Zich and Lyla? It is difficult to judge by the standards of ordinary people.”

“Still, I wanted to see a little closer. But now, even if it’s just for a little while, you’re thinking of falling off altogether.”

Johaim, who was the one who provided the cause of the fall, quietly shut his mouth. Noticing this, she panicked.

“Oh, I’m not blaming the Count. It's just that the two of you are so frustrated... .” "I know. You don't have to worry about it.” However, one word like that cannot calm the atmosphere. Here you have to change the subject yourself.

Joachim raised a topic that she would be very fond of.

“But I don’t think those two are very promising.”

Just as he intended, Evelyn followed the topic.

"Yes? To be honest, Lyla is just ignorant of the feeling of love, but she has an ordinary sensibility. How uninterested are you going to take me to the casino on a date?”

Evelynn dragged out her previous experience and groaned.

“I rather see promise in that regard.”

“In what way?”

What is the point of a person who has a ridiculous date plan that makes you think that there is hope?

“Actually, this is not the first time Zich has been on a camouflage date. I did it once when I first met you. The opponent was Mrs. Baggot. It was a woman who killed my family and ruined the estate.”

Evelynn quietly nodded as she knew something about it.

“At the time, Mr. Zeek approached Mrs. Baggot to see Mrs. Baggot, and she was very resourceful at the time. We were escorted so perfectly that in an instant, rumors spread that we were lovers.”

"Yes? Why is such a person this time... .”

“I was quite surprised by that too. And after a lot of thought, I came up with this guess.” To Evelynn, who looked at her with interest, Johaim gave the answer she was thinking of.

“The date with Lyla was not meant to be shown to others, but something that Zeek really enjoyed doing.”

“•••So what you did with Mrs. Baggott was just a disguise, and what you did with Ms. Lyla was a real date with Mr. Zich?”

"That's right."

Evelynn was momentarily shocked by a guess she had never imagined. But he was excited to find out that Joheim's conjecture met his wishes.

But it was also for a while. Her excitement quickly cooled.

“•••If that's what a real date is, isn't it serious as it is?”

Even Joachim couldn't answer that.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 313 Tuesday

Zich was riding a mountain. A deep forest where there are no cleared paths or even paths for wild animals. A dense tree obscures the view, and with every step, a brush brushes against it. Occasionally protruding tree roots or falling terrain tried to hold onto his ankles, but they couldn't be that much of a hindrance to Zich.

It was a place where only animals and monsters could go, except for people like hunters or herbalists, but his steps were not harsh. Isn't it Zich who prefers to run in a straight line on the map, whether it's a mountain, a field, or a river, rather than a highway even with the other party in the first place? Now, if you're feeling awkward, that's even weirder.

'It's quiet.'

Zich looked up at the sky. The moonlight quietly permeates in a small space amidst the thick waters. The sounds of numerous insects resound around you, and the howl of an unknown beast can be heard in the distance.

But Zich clearly felt an extreme silence now.

'By the way, how many times have I been alone like this?'

Even before returning, after building up a force, he fought the world with his subordinates, and even after returning, he has already had Hans with him since he came out of the count. It was a long time ago for Zich to travel alone like this.

'Hmm, this is good as it is, but it's also true that it's an enemy.'

Roll Hans and Snock... No, he trains and eats silly jokes with Lyla. And in the future, Elena will also be included there.

'Have you already gotten used to such daily life?'

If people who hated him enough to chew on him before his return saw him, wouldn't they be terrified and deny reality?

Aww!

As Zich was immersed in that thought, he heard the sound of a branch breaking nearby. Something was approaching. Is it Jim? However, Zich's senses were in denial of that guess.

Zich pulled Windur out of his back. An annoying sword that doesn't show any transformation ability unless it's still necessary. branch-like bladed bird

I heavily reflected the incoming moonlight

Crook!

A cry is clearly heard that is not human. With Windur hanging down, Zich only rolled his eyes and looked around. There is nothing out of sight because of the thick forest. However, Zich was perfectly aware of their movements.

'A total of seven guys.'

The opponent is an orc. The monsters I met so tired of every time I crossed the mountain. I usually let Hans or Snock take care of it, but now they don't.

'That's right, do you really miss them?'

Zich burst out laughing. Isn't it a really fun situation?

'Well, I was bored, but it was good.'

Zich slowly lifted Windur. Windur seems to growl with his teeth exposed.

'It will be enough to fill your heart out.'

Kwang!

In an instant, the Orcs burst out with a creepy shout. Zich's forearm muscles waved and Windur swung.

A terrible scream echoed through the forest. But for a while. The forest was again engulfed in dreary silence.

* * *

A large road is drilled in all directions around the huge city. The towering city in the middle of a plain without mountains seems to look down on the passers-by with majesty. There were no mountains around, so it felt even more like that.

There were many people going back and forth on the road. From merchants' wagons laden with goods for sale, to ordinary travelers with a cane and diligently playing with their feet.

It was no exaggeration to say that it was the logistics center of the Marquis of Campbell.

Zich was one of those who walked that path. He tugged at his feet and looked around.

'It must be a bit of a headache for sure.'

Usually bandits are based in the mountains. Because that would be the best way to avoid the subjugation army. However, there were no mountains near here. There are only a few hills that can be called wild.

Fortunately, there were a few forests a little far from the city that looked like places where thieves could stay, but the forests were not that big either.

I wondered if thieves were running wild in a place like this.

However, there were certainly thieves. People walking on the road backed off to the side, and a group of soldiers passed by. There was considerable vigilance in the eyes of the soldiers who were fully armed and marching, throwing their bewildered gazes in all directions. Those who were holding weapons were given even more ferocious eyes. His gaze stayed on Zich for a while and then disappeared.

It's not just a simple patrol. Perhaps it was to prevent thieves from attacking the road. Obviously, the situation looked serious.

You will see a long line to enter the castle gate. It seems that the checkpoints have been strengthened as the thieves around them are roaming around. Zich touched the magic box in his arms for a moment. Inside was a plaque and a certificate to prove his identity, which Johaim had received. Just show me this and I'll be right in.

But he got his hands out of the box.

'Let's move alone for the time being.'

You can go to the city officials for nothing and get control over your actions for nothing. There is no one here who can guarantee Sieg's freedom as much as Joheim did.

First, as originally planned, he decided to run around the city ignorantly to detect the presence of the bandits.

Zich quietly lined up at the back of the castle gate. It was a time when I was waiting in line with only my feet twitching. Suddenly, the gates opened wide and a group of troops came out. They all rode on horseback and sprinted along the highway at high speed. People were startled, and Boon-bun fled to the side.

Zich looked at them.

'What happened?'

I don't know if a thief might have attacked it. Zich quietly stepped out of the line. Activated the invisibility artifact created by Lyla. Fortunately, the people's necks were packed with the troops that just ran out, so they didn't notice Zich's disappearance.

The soldiers followed the road and turned right at the fork in the road. It was a different path from where Zich came from. Sieg followed the soldiers and entered the path on the right.

how far did it go Zich noticed that the faces of the people coming from the highway were frozen. There were also people whose faces were empty, like those who were terrified.

It was clear there was something.

After a while, the troops arrived at their destination. And Zich also hid around it.

It was a path through a small forest near Bembice. Even so, the width of the road was wide enough that it was continuously managed by the city.

The road that had always served as a good guide for people and an assistant in comfortable movement has now turned into a scene of terrible slaughter.

Most of them penetrated into the soil, but only the blackened surface of the road could tell you the horror of the slaughter at the time. Three bodies. All were mutilated to the point of being unrecognizable.

The soldiers got off their horses and began to take control of the situation. People walking on the road turned to one side of the road and moved cautiously. The onlookers who were watching the scene also dispersed.

Zich kept some distance from the commotion and climbed onto a branch to secure his view.

The scene of the incident caught my eye.

'It's not the monster's work.'

Seeing the corpses so damaged that it was impossible to tell whether they were human or not, Sieg was convinced. The body had wounds from a sharp knife. It was obviously human work.

The bodies were naked. No matter how poor you are, no one walks around naked, so it must be said that someone stole it.

'It must be the work of thieves.'

The soldiers who were actually watching the scene were talking like that.

The identity of the victim was unknown. There is no identity verification, and the body has been mutilated so that its shape cannot be recognized.

People walking down the street stare intently at the scene. Their faces were full of fear.

But Zich was blunt. There was too much blood in his life for an incident of this magnitude to have any effect on his mind.

'If this is a serious matter, it will be of great help to Yoheim when the case is resolved.'

Rather, that's what I was thinking.

Zich quietly left. There was nothing more to be gained from that field. At the mouth of the forest, he quietly erased the invisibility so that others would not notice. And it seeped into the people walking on the highway.

After some time, he was able to enter Bembice.


Zich found a lodging and walked around the city. Indeed, the streets were full of people as it was the center of logistics for the Marquis of Campbell. Rare items were also seen at the stalls where people lived.

People's faces were lively. However, at first glance, there was a sense of insecurity.

'It must be because of the bandits.'

After walking around the city for a while, the sun began to set. hunger is gone First of all, we decided to have dinner and go home today.

Rather than a fancy dinner, I looked for a place where I could have a light meal and have a drink.

Compared to not long ago, when he and his party were noisy to solve meals, it was very comparable to that, so Zich laughed.

'Was I such an emotional guy?'

Should I be angry because I lost my heart, or should I be amazed that I have this kind of image?

'How are you? If you like yourself, that's how you live.'

It was when Zich was about to enter the food store that appeared in front of him.

He stepped aside slightly.

quaang

The door to the store opened violently and a man flew in. The man who rolled on the street several times did not move as if he had lost his mind.

People walking down the street shouted at the sudden situation. Zich walked into the store.

The inside of the store was a mess.

The table is upside down and the chairs are overturned. Some were even broken. Dropped food and drinks are polluting all over the store.

And there were also figures of people lying in the middle and moaning.

The walls of the store were lined with people who seemed to be customers. They show emotions of anger, fear and contempt.

After scanning the surroundings, Zich looked at the center of the store.

I saw three men besieging one. It was doubtful that one person was being beaten, but strangely, it was the number of pages who were frightened.

“You motherfucker!”

One of the hordes attacks the besieged. As if he had pulled it out, he was holding a small dagger in one hand. A few people who saw it screamed.

However, there was no sound of a sharp knife cutting through the skin and muscles. Instead, a dull sound of broken bones resounded.

“Aww!”

The man who jumped in with a weapon fell down with a painful scream. The arm he held the sword was limp and limp.

“Damn it!”

“Kill!”

The other two men even attacked, but the besieged did not blink an eye. Rather, it broke the bones of the other two at the speed of light.

The fight was over in an instant. Zich looked at the winner of the fight.

Randomly grown long ponytail hair. Although he had a face like a refreshing hot man, his ferocious expression made me want to approach him.

The man was wearing an atmosphere like a beast.

You can hear the voices of people watching the fight around you. That tough guy seemed to be quite famous.

But it was never famous for the good. Often, words such as garbage or human slang were heard.

“Look, you bastards!”

He rolls his eyes and presses the onlookers around him. The onlookers quickly turned their eyes.

Perfect yangachi pronunciation by anyone looking at it. His eyes, looking around, turned to Zich.

Was it because he didn't like Zich's gaze? He tightened his eyes and glared at Zich. Anyone can see it right before the fight.

If it was a normal Zich, they would stare at each other asking what they looked like, and if the other person had an argument, they would have raised their fists in joy.

But to his surprise, Zich lowered his eyes slightly. Then he quietly stuck to the wall and moved to a place where other onlookers were.

If there was Lyla next to her, she would suggest that she be ill and go to see a priest or a doctor right away, very kindly and worryingly.

Yangachi, who continued to stare at Zich with distasteful eyes, snorted as if he had lost interest soon enough and opened his eyes.

And I kicked the stomachs of the fallen ones one more time and walked to the entrance of the store.

“Come on, wait… !”

It's a hesitant yet urgent sound. Yangachi glanced at the owner of the voice. The person who spoke was a chubby middle-aged man with half-haired hair.

He took a step back, hiccuping as if frightened, after receiving the gaze of the sheep-chief. Then he slowly opened his mouth.

“Ah, no matter how much you have to pay for the store… .”

It must have been the owner of the store. Haha, the store is in a mess, so the owner would want some compensation.

Moreover, the household items have been destroyed to some extent, even if the store is just messed up.

No matter how frightening the opponent is, as long as you are the owner of the store, you will not be able to let them go.

But the master's courage did not end there.

"what?"

Yangachi frowned and clenched his fists. There was a crackling sound at the joint joint.

It was a threat that would not even cause ridicule to those who had some training, but it was a sufficient threat to the shopkeeper, an ordinary person who did not live very close to violence.

The store owner shut his mouth. I rolled my eyes.

Yangachi, who looked at him pitifully, spit on the floor as if it were purple. The store owner didn't say anything.

With a snort, Yangachi went out. The inside of the store was quiet.

“Oh, let’s go too.”

The onlookers also noticed and immediately left the store. All that was left was the owner and Ji-kee, who stared blankly at the messed up shop.

Zich quietly followed the others and left the store.

In the distance, you can see the sheep go. Others looked at the young man's back and smirked softly, but chose a different path from him.

But Zich kept his distance from the bastard and began to follow him quietly.

Yangachi broke the road a few times and disappeared from Zich's sight. But Zich did not miss his back.

Soon Yangachi entered a certain dormitory. Zich peered in through the window next to the entrance.

Yangachi went up the stairs as if familiar. Perhaps staying here seemed certain. His footsteps continued into one room.

After finding out Yangachi's dormitory, Zich returned to the store where Yangachi was running.

On the front door of the store, there was a sign that no business was going on today.

When I opened the door, it was not locked. Zich went straight into the store.

The shopkeeper was mopping the floor with his shoulders drooping. Noticing that Zich had come in, he said a little uncomfortably.

“No business today. It must be written on the door.”

Zich didn't respond and headed to the inner table. It was time for the owner to make an impression and speak once more.

Tuk!

Zich placed a small sack on the table. The tip was slightly loosened, revealing the contents inside.

It was money.

The owner looked at Zich in surprise.

“It must be a lot more than the broken pieces plus the cost of the business today. I think this is enough to eat one meal of rice even if the restaurant is closed. Do you not have enough?” The owner shook his head. At first glance, it is an amount that is too large to be insufficient.

Zich pulled out a chair nearby and sat down.

“The most confident menu here and a bottle of alcohol.”

“Come on, wait a minute!”

This is an instruction from Eun-in who will turn today's misfortune into good fortune. The owner immediately ran into the kitchen.

After a while, the owner brought out a fairly large number of dishes and a bottle of alcohol that looked a bit pricey at the store. Then I glanced at Zich's eyes.

He had no money bag. Is he a surprisingly conscientious personality? Otherwise, is it simply timid?

Zich smiled and took a drink. Then he pointed to the money bag.

“The eggplant show.”

“Go, thank you.”

The owner hurriedly grabbed the money bag and tried to drag it. When he had more money than he expected, he opened his mouth and let out a helpless laugh.

“Master. After all, business seems to be dead today, can you answer my question?”

“Anyway! I'll answer everything I know!"

“You’re talking about the bastard who overturned this store earlier.”

The face of the owner, who seemed to be able to pluck up even the roots of the royal castle if he wanted to, was distorted in an instant.

“I’m curious to know what kind of guy he is.”

"that… .”

The owner hesitated for a moment to speak. Apparently, he was afraid of retaliation if he spoke carelessly about him.

chin!

Zich held out another bag of money. The master's eyes focused on the sack.

“Never say anything I heard from you.”

The owner's gaze moves back and forth between the bag of money and the jig. After a while, he took the bag of money and put it in his arms. and opened his mouth.

“He’s a twin bastard!”

He spit out swear words at once.

Still, there were so many things he wanted to say, he brought a chair and sat down with Zich. And he began to spit out cursing about Yangachi.

Yangachi's name is Tim Flat. Even in this city, he was said to be a badass, known for being quite vicious.

“When there is an argument like today, we fight by destroying things regardless of the situation or place. I don't even care about hitting anyone."

Zich dipped the bread into the soup and brought it to his mouth, listening attentively to the owner's story.

If the response of the listener is good, the speaker will also feel good. His mouth, which had been moving slightly awkwardly, moved more gently.

“Did you not report it?”

“Of course I did! But do the people above take care of this alley or a naughty bastard! Besides, he was arrested once, and was soon released for whatever reason he had! Only those who reported it for no reason were retaliated against!”

Not very surprising. It was not uncommon for corrupt gangs of city officials to take bribes to look after the mafia and thugs.

Perhaps Tim is one of those people, the owner said.

“It is the same today! Having an argument with some gangster-like thing! If we want to fight, we will go somewhere else to fight, so why do we fight in the store and damage things! I have no intention of paying a single penny for compensation!”

Apparently, the team and those who had an argument did not receive any compensation. So, it was directly attached to the money that Zich gave.

After that, the store owner continued to swear at the team. Zich nodded his head intermittently and ate all the drinks and food.

After eating, Zich left the store. The store owner politely sent off Zich.

The sun had completely set and the moon had risen, but Zich did not go home. The place he headed was in front of the dormitory where the team entered.

He climbed up to the surrounding rooftop and looked at the team's dorm like a stone statue. He looked like a creepy stalker.

As time passed, a light began to trickle out from the other side of the darkness. Until then, Zich didn't even budge.

Gradually, people began to take action. Still, Zich did not move.

After a while, the door of the dormitory, which Zich was looking at, opened, and the team came out. Zich's eyes lit up.

Tuk!

Zich lightly jumped off the building. And started following the team.

As the store owner said, the team was like a painting.

He walked around intimidatingly in the eyes of others, and if there was something he didn't like, he got angry and spit out abusive language. If there was an argument, it flew right away from the fist.

Zich looked at it carefully.


That night, the team went into a store. It was supposed to be for dinner.

Zich also took the time to follow him into the store and order him to eat. The taste was ok.

While eating the stew that came out, Zich constantly looked at the team.

how much time has passed

“I found it, you bastard.”

Someone smashed the store door and entered. They were familiar people.

'They were beaten by the team yesterday.'

The scars that still remained on his body were proof of that.

I am using the potions obtained through Zikya Rubella like water, but the original potions are very precious.

It was not strange that their scars, which could only be seen as back alley gangsters, remained as they were.

They were staring right at the team. Perhaps he came here for revenge. The number of pages was much higher than what we saw yesterday.

Tuk!

The team put the spoon down. And slowly got up.

“Oh, you damn bastards. Why do you only swear when you eat?”

He turned around, uttering harsh words.

The thugs flinched. It seemed that yesterday's fear had not gone away. However, they took courage by thinking of their own page numbers.

“Damn that bastard!”

So the store fell into chaos. The guests, who were enjoying their leisurely meal, get up screaming and cling to the wall.

The thugs were blocking the entrance with their large bodies, so they couldn't escape.

The owner of the store was helpless in this chaos and screamed as he watched the store being destroyed.

Only one person. Siegman continued to eat slowly. Rather, I looked at it leisurely as if I was a spectator of an interesting play.

“Ok!”

With a strange scream, a gangster flew towards Zich. Zich waved his hand lightly.

puck!

“Wow!”

The thug changed direction and crashed hard on the floor. However, Zich didn't care and still focused on the fight in front of him.

The fight was over soon. The situation in the hall was the same as yesterday.

Although the number of pages of the opponent increased, it was the same that it was the team flat that stood at the end, and the inside of the store was also the same.

“My, my shop… .” After giving one menacing stare to the muttering owner, the team approached the nearest collapsing gangster. And I kicked without mercy.

"I! once! I wish you could see it! I know you're lucky! quietly! crushed! Must be! where! In addition! Come on!”

The gangster crouched down as much as possible at the kick that didn't pay attention. It was when the complexions of the people around him became pale at the brutal scene.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! ”

A loud roar of laughter rang out. The eyes of the people all turned to the direction of the sound of laughter. The team stopped kicking.

The main character of the laughter was Zich. He jumped up from his chair.

“… What is this bastard?”

The team frowned at the unexpected situation.

Zich trudged towards the team. The team's face contorted even more. It was when he clenched his fist violently and was about to speak to Zich.

“What are you… !”

Bump!

Zich grabbed her hand. And he said in a voice full of laughter.

"okay! You trash bastard! You are definitely trash!”

The team's face changed in a strange way. But Zich didn't care. He was busy expressing his pleasure.

“It’s really nice to see you, you scum! Don't you know how good I feel because you're trash?"

To the bewildered team, Zich continued to throw garbage.

"then! you must be trash! Team flats in the world can't be garbage! Garbage among garbage! The ultimate garbage! Write  king of Reggie! "

“What, this bird!”

Tim shouted with a bloodline on his forehead, but Zich replied happily, not paying attention.

“Why, you scumbag!”

(Continued on next page)

# No. 315 screen

That was when Zich grabbed the back of his neck as he watched Joachim bathe in a pool of stagnant blood and Evelynn collects his neck in search of a handsome corpse.

“Why are you standing there, boss?”

A new voice was heard from behind. A person who calls Zich the boss. Zich's back ribs craved more.

Not wanting to check the back, Zich confirmed the owner of the voice by forcibly turning his neck, which did not move well like a wheel that had not been greased for a long time.

The first thing that catches your eye is your hair as white as snow.

A handsome face is visible under the hair that looks as if it has been through the ages. A handsome man with a thick line that looks quite exciting.

However, what finally catches the eye is neither the hair that looks like it has been hit by time nor the face that seems to easily win the favor of women.

right eyes.

The moment we met, it was so full of life that an ordinary person would have all the hairs on his body stand upright and urinate, and his legs would be full of energy and he would nod without a doubt even if he claimed to have implanted the devil's eye. .

Upon closer inspection, his body was covered with blood. Much of his white hair was dyed red, as if covered in red dye.

It wasn't his own. It was all the blood of the enemies lying somewhere in this death space.

He is one of Zich's men.

Team Flats, also known as Werewolves.

And among his subordinates, he was the one who did not listen to Zich the most.

For Zich, who was tired of Joachim and Evelyn's travels, the appearance of the team was not welcome. It's probably going to cause a lot more irritation and anger at Zich than I do.

“What are these guys doing?”

Tim looked at Joachim and Evelynn and clicked his tongue.

“As you can see, Joachim is bathing in blood and Evelyn is collecting handsome necks.”

“Anyway, they’re like perverts. How the hell do you have to roll your head to think like that?”

Joachim and Evelynn seem to have heard his voice too. Joachim clicked his tongue sarcasticly once, and Evelynn stared openly.

But the team rather stretched their chest. His words, without even saying 'what, what?', seemed to float around like echoes.

“… What is your guy talking about?”

“What am I? It’s very sad when the boss says something like that.”

Among Zich's close associates, Tim was the person he had the most affinity for. Both were greedy for strength.

But there were also clear differences. Ji-kee had a little water bathing, but the team had a lot of water bathing.

Zich was close to not caring about killing, but the team enjoyed slaughter. And while most of the people Zich trampled and ridiculed were enemies, the team trampled and insulted everything that he felt were weaker than him.

To put it simply, Zich was a seeker of pure power, and Tim enjoyed wielding it.

That's why Zieke's other aides didn't hesitate to call the team trash.

But no one really criticized the team.

In the first place, all the guys called Mine are crazy people and garbage, so what kind of accusation is that? It was just a joke between colleagues.

'Of course, it's true that you think it's trash.'

Isn't that great teamwork? If these goalscorers are punishment for their sins, I wondered if it would be better to do a little good deeds from now on.

'But how do you do that?'

Not knowing how to do it, Zich hit him right away.

The team roamed around and kicked the corpses. It looked like they were checking to see if anyone was alive. But there were only obvious corpses lying around.

Whoops!

One corpse was kicked hard by the team. The corpse, which had been entangled with other corpses, as if it were one huge piece of meat, fell on top of the other corpses and stood out.

The corpse was quite well armed, unlike the other corpses. The clear crest engraved on the breastplate made us guess that he was a fairly high-ranking person.

“What kind of guy are you?”

Jack asked.

“Don’t you remember? Aren’t these guys the ones who talked about justice and judgment in front of the chief?”

“… Oh, was it him?”

There were not one or two of those guys, but Zich listened to those stereotypes with one ear and spilled it with the other. However, not long after hearing the words of the corpse in front of me, I remembered even vaguely.

“By the way, he was the first to follow you.”

"Yes."

The team chuckled. Then he kicked the corpse. He doesn't use magic, but his body is already a weapon. The body was getting crushed.

“Anyway! mouth only! Mountain! young! It’s the same!”

Kicking and accusing

A sad smile appeared on the team's lips.

Evelynn sneaked up to Zich and asked.

“What is that pervert bastard doing?” It was Zich who wanted to go back to her words and gossip about the team with her, but when he saw the heads hanging from her waist, he couldn't stop his mouth from falling.

He looked up at the sky, but this time he looked at Yo Haim.

He filled his hands with blood and sprinkled them into the sky. When the blood came pouring down like rain, the sun was shining brightly as it hit it.

'••• Do you really want to find out about good deeds?' Seeing his subordinates who had no answers, Zich remembered that thought again.

Jiku, who had escaped from the momentary thoughts of the past, checked the human in front of him once again.

Appearance, personality, voice, and even a distinctive frown. It was a complete Werewolf Team Flat look.

'okay! That's it!'

How crazy has it been so far? Doesn't the guy who got the nickname "vampire" because of his ability to handle blood have a phobia of blood, and the guy who got the nickname succubus by squeezing men's spirits to death has andrphobia?

Because of this, it was assumed that Tim Flatt, who had a violent tendencies, was either a non-violent or a coward.

However, Tim Flatt really appeared in front of him in the form of complete garbage, as he was before his return.

How could you not be impressed?

'You did a really good job avoiding the fight in the first place!'

The first reason Zich quietly passed the team's dispute was to make sure he was really trash. And after observing him for a day, Tim Flatt was clearly trash.

It's like meeting a trending person in a foreign country.

But to the end, it was just Zich's feelings. The team, who held hands without knowing the English language and heard garbage in front of them, naturally got angry.

“What, you crazy bastard!”

Roughly shake hands and swing fists. He was in a very bad mood, and his fists were loaded with considerable power.

No matter how unpredictable Zich was, there must have been a sense of crisis that they held hands too easily.

But Zich barely avoided the fist.

The team was surprised. I hope you can avoid your own fist. This time, he hasn't lost his strength as much as he did when dealing with other gangsters.

But it wasn't just the team that was surprised. Zich was a bit surprised too.

'This guy is already pretty strong!'

But it was also understandable. Among Zich's four close aides, the one with the strongest fighting power was Team Flat. In the event of a large-scale clash between Zich's forces and other forces, he was the one who ran at the forefront.

The team's eyes narrowed. Suddenly, his shaky posture disappeared. Move your feet to straighten your center of gravity and raise your fists.

'Are you serious about fighting?' It's different from what I've been dealing with neighborhood gangsters. The people around them swallowed their breath at the momentum the team gave off.

Zich's hand trembled. My hands were itching as I wanted to pull out the Windur on the back of my back right away.

But unlike the team, Zich is a person who wants to do good things first. You can't fight in a store with a lot of people like this. And I didn't even want to fight the team in the first place.

“I’m sorry about this.”

Zich raised his hand as if he had no will to fight.

“It’s like someone you know. I was mistaken.”

“… If you're sorry, I'll just kill you."

He raised his hand, but Zich was exuding a breath that seemed to run for battle at any moment.

“I think if I release the tension here, you will run right in.”

“Do I look like that?”

“Do you think you are not?”

If it was a team that Zich knew, he was a guy who would make a hundred surprise attacks.

Tim stared at Zich. He thought he wanted to rush in and kill Zich, but he didn't see him as a good opponent.

A feeling of intimidation of heavy pressure on the muscles and surroundings that are tight so that they can move at any time even though they raise their hands. And even the bizarre shape of the sword that he carried on his back.

But the team did not back down. Zich easily guessed the reason.

'He's a guy who hates being looked down on. If you step back and be treated like a coward, you must be thinking about what to do.'

If so, it is best to build the other person's self-esteem.

“I’m really sorry. I sincerely apologize for calling you trash.”

Then Zich took out a jewel and threw it at Tim. The team's eyes widened.

“That would suffice as an apology reward.”

Tim looked at the jewel and looked at Zich. His eyes dripping with greed seemed to want to take away all of Zich's burden.

However, he did not rush to see if he was sure that he could defeat Zich.

"•••great! I even gave you a reward like this, so I’ll pass it on generously.”

The team put the jewel in their bosom.

"Luck  great line  I know you."

And the team left the store. Zich looked at him happily.

'It's very nice to have no concept.'

It was really such a feeling.

The fun reunion with the team made Zich very happy, but he didn't forget what he had to do.

He went outside the castle. Then, after boosting the senses to feel the presence as far away as possible, he started running around the city frantically.

I used invisibility artifacts where there were people. I couldn't let the rumors circulate that there were people running around the city like crazy.

As he is a shameless Zich, it doesn't matter what the people around him look like, but he could even get into the ears of thieves and give him a strange sense of crisis.

For several days, Sieg searched the city. Since it took several days for Zich, who can run around quickly, the scope of its search was literally beyond imagination.

But nothing caught on. Occasionally I found people living outside the city, but they were all poor people who had been driven out of the city. They were human beings who could not be called thieves in terms of numbers and movements.

No results today. Zich sat down in the field around the city.

'It's getting harder.' At least there is no base for thieves in this area.

'Now what?'

The first thing that comes to mind is to keep running around the city, attacking the scene where thieves are attacking people.

But it was a plan that depended too much on luck. In addition, when I was inquiring about the thieves the last few days, I realized that the radius of activity of the thieves was never small, so it was even less realistic.

But Jack didn't give up. It wasn't that I didn't think about it at all.

The current situation is that no matter how much you search outside the city, there is no base for thieves.

'It's simple. If it's not outside, it'll be inside.'

Jack looked back. The thick walls of Bembice looked like a gray curtain hiding something inside the city.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 316 screen

Jack opened the door. There was a loud noise with a delicious smell. Without hesitation, I stepped into it.

It was the same restaurant that I had stopped by a few days ago that was throwing the word trash at Tim.

As if the commotion at that time was a lie, the restaurant was full of life. The owner, who had seen the messy shop as if the sky had fallen, is now sweating profusely and taking orders.

Zich raised his hand to place the order.

"Yes! what to give... !”

The owner who brought the menu looked at Zich and looked surprised. He seemed to recognize Zich.

In fact, it's strange that he forgot about it after a few days since he sang garbage and garbage songs while holding the hand of Yang Archie, who was acting in the store.

“Aren’t you going to take my order?”

"Yes? Ah yes"

The owner brought out the menu. After ordering a decent meal and a glass of beer, the owner hurriedly got the menu and went back.

Zich looked around the store.

'No.'

The person he was looking for was nowhere to be seen. But Zich was not disappointed. If it's someone he knows, there's a good chance he's looking for Zich.

Besides, doesn't he already know where he's staying?

However, since it was more convenient for him to come to him with his intentions first, he was going to wait for a few days at the place where I met him to make it easier to find him.

'I don't think I need to wait that long.'

The owner's attitude was strange. It's like seeing an object cursed when it's close.

He has no reason to do that. Although there was a problem with the team at the store, it was resolved well and there were no other problems with the owner.

Maybe he was worried that the team might be doing something wrong after receiving Zee as a guest for nothing.

But Zeek put more weight on other possibilities.

'The team is looking for me.'

Then the attitude of the store owner is understandable.

Sheep, who ruined her shop, is the person she's looking for. You probably don't want to go anywhere near it. Do you think I would want to kick you out right away?

But as a human being associated with the team, that option would have disappeared as well.

If the fact that the fact that you kicked out the person you're looking for for nothing comes to the team's ears, they may turn the store upside down again.

So the owner would want Zich to finish his meal and leave the store as soon as possible.

“Here it is.”

If Zich's guess was correct, his food came out much faster than the other tables.

However, Zich had no desire to grant his master's wishes.

He breaks the bread and dips it into the soup. and took it to the mouth. A savory and salty scent lingered in my mouth.

'It's a pretty good place too.' You don't know how many days you will have to come, but if the food doesn't taste good, you'll definitely be annoyed.

Zich enjoyed the meal, savoring the taste. The pace was slow.

The owner, who looked at him from afar, seemed restless, but Zich didn't care.

So I ate the food and drink neatly and put down the tableware. It looked like the owner didn't do it. But the relief was too quick.

Zich raised his hand and called for the owner.

“Light snacks and one more beer.”

The owner desperately swallowed the cries that came out.

As if to tease the owner who looked at him with his burning heart, Zich sipped his drink. Then, I checked every single one of who entered the store.

The door to the store opened. Zich's eyes reflexively turned towards the door.

The owner, who was moving to receive customers while swallowing a few sighs, froze because of the Zich, who was constantly hanging out in the store. On the contrary, Zich's eyes twinkled with delight.

It was Tim who entered the store.

In his usual flirtatious look, the team glanced through the store.

Zich averted his eyes from Tim. Then, as if he had never seen him, he drank his glass.

approaching footsteps. Both feet stopped next to Zich's table.

Jack shook his head. Tim was standing next to him.

Jack asked.

"what's going on?"

“Don’t you remember me?”

“It comes. So I'm asking. Because I know that we are not in a relationship to chat. Wasn't it possible that all the troubles of that day were not resolved?"

“It’s resolved. It’s been released.”

Tim laughed as he revealed his yellow teeth. He pulled out the chair across from Zich and sat down. and shouted to the owner.

“Here's a beer!” The owner looks at him with an indescribable expression. However, he hung his head down and moved to prepare a drink as if he had given up.

“It doesn’t mean that you don’t want to pay, is it?”

"Huh? What are you talking about? i have a lot of money They don't steal a glass of alcohol like this."

But Zich continued to stare suspiciously.

“I shouldn’t put it on the price of the food I ate later on.”

“Okay, I got it. I pay for this drink in advance. Is that okay?”

Tim took money from his pocket and put it on the table. It was more than the price of a beer. The owner brought the beer and handed it the money.

“Let’s count here first. Bring the change.”

"Ah yes… .”

The owner was terrified that he might get hurt later if he received this money, but he couldn't refuse to pay for the drink.

The owner took the money and hurried away from their table.

“Okay, what’s going on? Even if it was resolved well, I don’t think I would have sat down at the table of the person who had a problem.”

“Why are you being so stiff? I'm a no-brainer I forgot all about it.”

It's a lie. Zich was sure.

The team was never dirty if the back end was dirty.

No matter how much Tim Flat was in front of him, he wasn't the Werewolf he knew, but his actions he had seen so far were enough to convince him that it was a lie.

Zich smirked and drank the beer. It was enough to show that Zich didn't believe the team.

Naturally, the dog-like team felt bad.

“What, you don’t believe me?”

“Would you believe me?”

Zich answered in half. Fortunately, the expression on the team's face, which was smiling forcibly, hardened.

The expression of the store owner, who was watching the situation from afar, also hardened in the strange atmosphere that flowed between them.

“… Because this child speaks well!”

“Are you coveting my money?”

Zich interrupted the angry Tim. The team shut up.

Zich was perplexed when he realized what he was doing. Should I affirm or deny it? Should I keep getting angry, or should I continue the conversation in a friendly way?

The timing of Zich's interruption was so good that the team's thoughts were messed up.

'Cute child.'

When you look at it like this, it just looks less ripe.

Well, okay. I can give you more.” In the end, the team, who had decided to keep getting angry, and who was about to shout, was interrupted once again.

“But there must be a price.”

"•••cost?"

“Yeah, the price. At that time, I was rude and compensated for that. The reward was quite high, though. But now I have no reason to reward you. If you want money in such a situation, of course there has to be a price.”

“•••What kind of price are you talking about?”

“Don’t change places. There are a lot of listeners here. Besides, it seems that someone is paying attention.”

The team looked around. When his eyes met, people quickly lowered their heads.

The team makes an impression and glares at them. I even tried to scream, but I missed the timing this time because Zich stood up.

Zich lifted the glass and drank the rest of the drink at once.

thud!

Roughly laying down the glass, he left the store, leaving the food on the table.

The wind-like action forced the team to stare blankly at the door where Zich came out.

“•••Aww, nigga!”

Perhaps because things didn't go the way he had thought, the team who spit out a swear word quickly drank the rest of the beer like Zich. And hurriedly followed after Zich.

A famous Yangachi nearby quietly retreated. Besides, even if it was a drink, I got paid.

The owner sighed in relief, thanking him for today's luck.

The team followed Zich's back no matter what. Sharp eyes scanned all parts of Zich's body.

'Should I jojo?'

As Zich's guess, the team came looking for Zich's money.

Last time, he received only one jewel and retreated gracefully due to Zich's formidable momentum.

However, when I came back to the dorm and thought about it, it was too sad to let go of Hogu, who was willing to give me a lot of money in spite of such a small dispute.

It seemed that the opponent's skills were quite good, but the team did not even think that their own skills were inferior.

But the use of force was later. First, we had to make friends and see if there was any way to scrape the money.

With that thought in mind, the team set out to find Zich. But it's very difficult to find a single person in this big city.

Besides, didn't Zich spend most of his time outside the city looking for thieves?

That's why the team regularly visited the store where they had contact with Zich.

The effort paid off and the team was able to find Zich. Conversely, Zich was able to find himself by inferring the thoughts of the team, but the team did not know.

If he can defeat Zich, all he owns is his. The team's hand twitched.

But in the end, the team gave up on the raid.

'Because I'm pretty sure it's not a hoax.'

His instincts were sounding a warning that this man was in danger. He doesn't even think he's geography, but he won't win easily.

'Even if they raid, it's not in the city.'

If the battle is long, there are too many things to hinder.

Let's hear the story first. With that in mind, the team brushed off their complicated thoughts and walked along with Zich at ease.

'I gave up.'

Zich was anticipating everything the team was thinking. Because of this, most of the senses were focused on the team even though the eyes looked forward.

At some point, the gloomy sign that had continued to appear after catching up with him disappeared at some point. It looks like we've decided to have a conversation.

It was also good for Zich. Because he didn't have to cut the neck of his former subordinate right away.

The place where Zich took the team was a shabby back alley. No lights, no people.

'No one.'

Perhaps they had fallen into a trap, and the team that had been sharpening their minds realized that there was no sign of feeling, so they relaxed a little.

“Can you tell me soon? If you are looking for a place where there are no people, I think this will suffice.”

“Surely it is.”

Zich turned around. The team shrugged.

“How important was it for you to bring me to this place? At this point, there will be a lot of curiosity.”

“I will. But isn't this what you want more than solving your doubts?"

Zich took a jewel out of his pocket. Greed flashed in the team's eyes.

'After all, this guy is quite rich.'

"right. You know me well.”

“I thought you would like it too.”

But Zich put the jewel back in his arms. The team's eyes frowned.

"what? Why put it back?”

“I told you. this is the price You have to give me what I want to give you this.”

“What do you want?”

Zich asked Tim with anticipation and concern in his heart.

“What do you know about the bandits roaming around here?”

(Continued on next page)


# No. 317 Tuesday

"•••thief?"

The team looked confused. Am I saying something out of the ordinary? If not... .

'Is it related to the thieves?'

Zich observed the team's behavior closely.

“Well, come to think of it, I heard that a swarm of new thieves has appeared around here.”

It's a fight that he doesn't know. But is that really true?

“Then you don’t know?”

"right. I don't know what to say, but I'm just an ordinary bastard running around the back alleys. There's no comparison to those scary guys."

The team shuddered. Zich grinned.

“Are you aware that you are an asshole?”

“Keuk! People like us, don't you know who you are? On the contrary, I understand myself much better than others who don't understand the subject. Of course, what I say and what I hear from others are completely different things.”

And it seemed like he didn't like to hear the chirps when he was staring at Zich.

Jack wasn't angry. If you're such a guy, you're an asshole.

“Didn’t you hear the rumors floating around?”

"Well… .”

It looks like the team is thinking with their arms crossed. Zich showed him the jewel he had put in his arms earlier. Tim glanced at the jewel with his eyes twinkling.

“It’s hard to give this if you can’t pay it.”

The team's face darkened. Anyone can see that the sarcasm is broken.

It's only natural that he won't get paid for not providing the information he wanted, but he knew the team would never think that way.

'You're probably thinking that it's normal for you to receive jewels. You'd think my question was a wicked plan and a hindrance to not giving you gems.'

Even a clear stream flowing deep in the mountains would be harder to see than the mind of a guy.

swish!

Zich threw a jewel at Tim. The team hastily accepted the bail.

It's been a while since I smiled at the luster that was clearly visible in the dark. He looked at Zich.

“Didn’t you decide not to give without payment?”

“It’s prepaid.”

“Prepaid?”

“Use all your contacts and learn about the thieves. More money depending on the importance of the information.”

“What if I don’t know?”

“Of course there is no money. However, the one I gave you now is prepaid, so there is no need to return it.”

Tim looked at the jewel he was holding for a moment before putting it in his arms.

“Can we say that the deal has been accepted?”

“Where do I go when I know the information?”

Zich said the name and location of the hostel he was staying at.

“When you come, come in the evening. I am busy during the day.”

“Looking for thieves?”

"right."

“May I ask why you are looking for thieves?”

Jack smiled bitterly.

“Why are you looking for such rubbish? Of course, I’m looking for you to catch and run.”

“Looks like you’ve been hurt.”

“It is not. But the victims aren't the only ones trying to get rid of such rubbish."

“Are you hired by the city?”

“This is all I can give you. And you don't even know? there's no coffin. All you have to do is give the thieves information and get my money back. Isn’t it simple?”

"Right. Okay, let me ask you a question. If you find something, come visit me.”

“If I could give you one piece of advice, you should get it as soon as possible. Because I'm not playing either. You are not the only informant.”

“Keep in mind.”

The team turned around.

“Ah, one more question, do you really not know about thieves?”

The team stopped.

"••• Didn't I say I didn't know?"

"Yes it was. I just checked again. Can go."

“The ignorant bastard.”

The team spit out once and left the alley.

Zich, who was left alone, looked up at the sky for a moment. A large moon appeared in his eyes.

'That's already been the case since then.'

Tim had a habit of wriggling the index finger of his right hand when telling a lie or swearing something.

It was a small movement that even a person with good eyes could not detect properly, but Zich, who had been with him for a long time before returning, knew.

'Team guy is definitely related to the bandits.'

But to what extent are they really related? I had to know that.

Eventually, Zich also disappeared into the darkness along the path where Tim had disappeared.

Zich continued his investigation for several days. He inquired about thieves in the city and ran around the city relentlessly to see if he could catch the attack site.

But there were no traces of the thieves.

However, the raid by thieves did not stop. The thieves were constantly attacking the tops heading towards the city.

'After all, these guys seem to have a base in the city.'

Then things get even more complicated. No matter how quietly thieves have the ability to infiltrate a city, they can't go in and out of their homes like this.

'I don't know if I've found something like a dog hole that others don't know, but if I'm walking through the gate, there must be an insider among the officials.'

The idea of ​​making his identity known to the city with that took a bit further.

If there is an insider in the management, there is a risk that it will spill over to the thieves no matter what Zich plans.

It would be better to move quietly under the water for the time being.

I even thought about following the team, but immediately discarded that method as soon as I thought of it.

Tim was excellent at detecting the surrounding presence, as was the nickname for the Werewolf.

This was the last time I followed him. It was possible because Zich's skills were good, and the team didn't have a high level of vigilance.

'But now it's different.'

The fact that Zich can be followed is enough for even a simple guy like Tim.

If he really has anything to do with thieves, he's probably going to stick with it for now. Follow-up is impossible.

For now, Zich decided to wait to see what information the team would bring.

One day after so many days.

Knock! Knock!

Late at night, someone knocked on Zich's dorm door.

"come in. I’m not asleep.”

Without even checking who it was, Zich called in the visitor. The door opened and a visitor appeared.

it was a team

As if waiting, Zich pointed to the chair opposite him.

"sit down."

The team sat down on the chair. He leaned back on the backrest and leaned his body to the side. If there was a model textbook for Yangachi, it would be him.

“Does being here mean that you have information?”

"right. It’s been hard to find out.”

“Okay, tell me.”

“Why is this? Aren't you supposed to pay money first?"

Zich smiled and took a sack from his pocket.

I put it down on the table and loosened the string that fastened the bag. The splendid gold shimmered in the reflection of the candles.

Tim took his hand to the sack as if possessed. But before his hand could reach it, Zich grabbed the hilt.

"what are you doing!"

The team growled as if they were going to jump right away. Zich took a handful of money out of his pocket.

Using his magical powers, the money in his hand was about half of the sack. Siek threw the bag of money minus the money he took out at the team.

“At half. After hearing the rest, if I am satisfied.”

"satisfied? There was no such condition!”

“Then did you think you would get this much money from the gossip you would get on the market floor? No matter how free you are in the world, you must not be free of your conscience.”

Zich moved his hand to make the money clashed, making a sound.

“If you want to receive information.”

"Damn it!"

Team Koo raised his legs roughly on the table. It was very rude, but Zich didn't blink.

"great! I will tell you!”

However, contrary to shouting, the team did not intend to unravel all the information. Little by little, I was going to get the information out and find out Zich's money.

However, before returning, he, who was famous for having a haircut even when he was under him, could not be a match for him.

"By the way, I know that the thieves' base is in the city."

The team was terrified.

'What is it, you bastard! How!'

It's something the city hasn't even noticed yet. But, that kind of information is leaking from Zich, who seemed like a bum with a lot of money.

“So, tell me other information besides that information.”

“•••The thieves are in the city. What does that mean?”

A team that has been in denial in a mess. However, there was no way that Zich could fall for such pretentiousness.

“It’s simple. I've been looking outside the city for myself. But there was none outside the city. Then the only thing left is the city.”

“Is there only a city? Even in the city right now, soldiers are scouring the outside of the city, how do you know that? Chances are good enough to be outside the city... .”

" does not exist."

Zich just cut it out and said. Tim's eyebrows twitched.

“It is very basic information that there are bandits in the city. If you didn't even know that, there'd be no need for any more deals."

Zich threw the gold coin he was holding onto the table at random. Then he pointed at the door with his finger.

“Look out. no more need to I'll even give you the bag of money you have, so take it."

The team did not move. Chori with bitter eyes stared at Zich. However, Sieg tried to get up without even paying attention to whether he was already treating the team as someone who had no idea.

“Damn it, okay!”

Tim exclaimed as he lowered his legs nervously. Zich sat back on the chair.

"information."

“I got it, damn it!”

Taking a deep breath, the team opened their mouths.

"right! The thieves are in the city!”

“You said I know about that.”

"Way… .”

“I don’t even need that. There must be an insider in the city administration.”

Tim's eyes widened.

“Don’t be so surprised. Bembice is the logistics center for the Marquis of Campbell. No matter how loose the boundaries are, it is not a place where wandering thieves can go in and out of their own accord. It's only natural to think that you have an insider. Whether the reason is a share in the profits or being threatened. So, if you want to give it out, give me other information.” At this moment, the team completely revised their assessment of Zich.

I swallow once and look at him. The abyss-like eyes seem to dig deep into his heart.

The team nailed it. If he gets caught up in this formidable person prematurely, he seems to vomit out everything he knows.

“•••Okay, did you say any other information?”

" there is?"

« TH I ” •百'… !

Tim shut his mouth. He seemed to ponder for a moment, then clenched his teeth.

"•••Hang in there. You will find out more.”

“There is nothing I can’t wait for. Okay, let me know.”

It was time for the team to stand up.

"for a moment. Should I leave the money?”

“… Wasn't this a giveaway?"

“Oh, didn’t you understand the meaning of the word? It was kind of like a farewell to you when you didn't meet my standards. But would you like to know more? Does that mean that you want to continue your relationship with me? Then it becomes an information fee again. So give  gayaji. Because you didn't give me any information."

thud!

The team threw the bag of money on the table.

"great. But from now on, is what I'm doing really risking my life? So, it would be better to have an information fee well prepared.”

"Sure. i have a lot of money You just have to be sure of things. So please, I hope you bring good information.”

Tim nervously left Zich's room. At the rough closed door, Zich looked at him with complicated eyes.

# No. 318 screen

It is a well polished road. It does not reach the paved roads of the districts with the residences of nobles and wealthy merchants.

However, it is much better than the district of common people, which turns into a filthy sludge mixed with all kinds of filth when it rains.

Several buildings stood on either side of the road.

Although the shapes and sizes were different, the buildings had in common a large signboard just above the entrance.

There are many wagons and people with luggage roaming the streets.

This was a commercial area close to all kinds of merchants. As the central city of logistics, the headquarters and branch offices of all kinds of trade associations were scattered in Bembice, where all kinds of goods were bought and sold.

Although they were gathered in the same district, they are not all the same.

Each company differs in its wealth, size, influence, etc., and it was the size of the company's building that best showed them.

A huge building that deserves to be counted among the many buildings.

Horses and wagons continued to come and go through the large front door, and numerous goods piled up or fell out of the warehouse, and all kinds of people came and went to the office to do business.

However, such congestion and heat disappeared like a lie as the sun went down and the moon rose.

The lock on the front door, where people and wagons passed, was firmly closed and people disappeared. The only people left were the guards guarding the warehouse.

They looked like mercenaries by looking at their harsh faces and ununited weapons.

Because of the high wall surrounding the building, their appearance was not clearly visible from the outside.

Is that so? They didn't seem very keen on guarding. Rather, they did not even seem aware that the sight of them crossing their legs or yawning was a sign of security.

Some of them gathered together and exchanged obscene rumors and giggled.

damn it!

The guard's head, who smiled lightly with a vulgar hand shape, was broken. Another guard, who was talking to him, panicked and drew his weapon.

"who… !”

damn it!

His head was also bent like a colleague.

Someone stood in front of the two people who grabbed the back of their heads and moaned.

“You bastards, what are you doing now?”

“Oh, Mr Flat!”

The security guards who confirmed the person who hit the back of the head immediately stood up straight.

“What are you doing now?”

“Ah, at the command of the boss… .”

"boss?"

As Tim's voice dawned on him, the guard quickly corrected his words.

“Oh, no! I was standing guard at the command of the captain!”

"okay. security. That's your job. Isn't that strange? As soon as I arrived, I didn’t see the guards standing on the guard, but only bastards who were busy playing with them.”

“That, that… .”

My eyes roll to and fro to find an excuse. However, the moment they looked into the eyes of the team to make excuses, they had no choice but to throw away the dozens of excuses they had in mind.

Unhuman eyes were looking at them. That ferocious energy and life were literally that of a wolf who had learned the taste of blood.

"I don't want you to act like real guards. Because I know very well that it's overkill for the garbage on the floor. But it's a different story if you don't even pretend to do it properly."

The team grabbed one of the guards' hair and pulled it to the front of his face.

“At least you don’t have to pretend to do it! Have you already forgotten how important this is? Shall I take the cap off the head and engrave it directly on the tiny brain!”

“Sin, sorry!”

“After all, people like you need an example.”

The team raised their hand. All five of his fingers stood stiff, forming a hand blade. It was a time when the fear of death fell heavily on the guard's eyes.

“Stop it.”

Tim turned his head. A man was walking hurriedly.

He had an angular face with a sharp and large sword at his waist, exuding a harsh atmosphere.

“That bastard isn’t your subordinate. not my load. No matter how much we are cooperating, I want you to keep the case.”

"case?"

The guard that the team was holding was roughly slammed into the ground. He groaned as he put his face firmly on the floor.

It didn't seem like it was life-threatening, but the fact that the blunt nose was completely slumped down seemed like a broken nose bone.

“Well done, you bastard! No, you guys still don't really understand how great and important this is, can I explain it again in a very kind and caring way?"

“Of course, that explanation is with your fists, right? There’s nothing I can’t accept, but if I did, wouldn’t that great and important thing be destroyed?”

“Looking at your nonsense, you are sure to fail. It would be better for me to overturn it than to get a vase in my mind!”

The square-faced man looked at Tim's fingertips. Is it an eye illusion? It feels like the team's nails are getting longer.

Not good. Although he was fighting the team proudly in order not to look easy, the man knew well that if they did, they would be ripped to pieces by the team's hands.

Eventually, the man took a step back.

"okay. I knew it. Warning once again to allies and subordinates. Oh, no matter how trivial the situation is, don’t let your mind down.”

“It’s not just words. They're all ignorant, so they need an example."

“••• Do it in moderation, Tim Flat.”

The square-faced man made a grim impression for the first time.

“We are in a position to cooperate, not your subordinates. But are you going to use other people’s subordinates as an example?”

“It’s you guys who should do it in moderation. This number is bigger than anything you guys have ever done. You have to put a lot of effort into it. But how many pieces of garbage are you asking to stop working?”

The team pointed to the guards. The guards, who were trembling like a rat in the corner, were terrified as they watched the passing of the situation.

"If you're going to do this with such a rotten mind, hit me right now! Or will you make me beat you?”

The team's eyes lit up. At that moment, the square-faced man knew he couldn't stop the team anymore.

“••• Can't beat it. ok ok But it's up to me to make them an example. Because it's my load. This is the last thing I can yield.” The man with the square face felt his lips dry. This is where the situation changes depending on how the team comes out.

Fortunately, the worst did not come.

"•••great. However, if you check it later and pass softly, you won't be able to sit still. Be sure to tell the others to come to their senses.”

"I get it."

As Tim turned around, the square-faced man sighed. First, the worst case of a head-on collision is avoided. He clicked his tongue as he saw the team behind the fence and out of the building.

'Anyway, that dirty-tempered hair.'

Although he has a temper, he is still nothing compared to the team. He was literally a crazy dog.

After spitting at the place where Tim disappeared, he looked at the subordinate who caused this trouble.

They stiffened their bodies and waited for the disposition to come forward.

"Hey."

The man looked back. There were several other subordinates waiting at a certain distance.

“Kill these bastards. And as a warning, take off the neck and give it to the others.”

“Two, boss!”

"please… !”

Kwajik!

Blood spurted from the mouths of the two guards. A man with a square face swung his fists.

“How many times have I told you not to shout!”

And he kicked the fallen subordinates without hesitation. They couldn't even make a loud scream, just crouched and beaten.

Kicking to relieve his anger, he gave orders to the other men.

“Take it away!”

The weeping guards were dragged along by the other subordinates. Others who ran into the commotion watched it with a firm look.

'For now, I'm sure I'll be an example according to the guy's words.'

However, the man did not simply admit his faults toward himself and his subordinates. In the first place, he was pure garbage, passing all his faults to others.

"Red!"

He snorted and turned nervously.

“What are you doing? Without returning to work!”

The subordinates hurriedly return to their seats. After taking a bad look at his subordinates, he also left.

Thus, a series of commotions in the middle of the night ended.


'They are like dogs who run wild without knowing the importance of work!'

The team hasn't been released yet. He wanted to go back and shave the man with an angular face in a circle, and his subordinates also wanted to make porridge.

They weren't even a fistful, but I couldn't kill them either. First of all, they were allies of the plan.

'If only I had power!' He also needed his own power. Having succeeded in this plan, he vowed to create his own faction.

But it was kind of like just passing through. In particular, the man with the square face was the one who collided with the team in every case.

'Come to think of it, the main target of these guys was Demyro, wasn't it?'

A mean smile appeared on the team's lips.

Zich sat facing Tim. The team came to us while we were going to end the day with a drink. There is only one thing for him to come.

Zich asked with anticipation, but with a blunt outward appearance.

“Are you sure you came looking for information that I didn’t know properly this time?”

"of course!"

The team's voice was full of confidence.

“Okay, tell me.”

“There is something I want to ask you first.”

"what?"

“Do you have any money?”

“Does that have anything to do with getting information?”

“Yes. If you are the information information street, don't you know? It costs money to get information. If there is something that needs to be done, I will hire someone, if there is someone I need to cooperate with, I will give it some oil, and if there is something a little dangerous, I will cover it up.”

Zich let out a soft exclamation. But it wasn't pure admiration. Rather, it was a bit of a sneer.

“Where did you get valuable information from? All I wanted from you was the rumors going around in the back alleys. And I didn't expect that much."

The team was furious. But I did my best to persevere. Once you know how much money Zich has, you can judge the effort he will put in.

'If you don't have a lot of money, you should give it a reasonable amount of false information and rip it off.'

However, considering the actions of Zich, who willingly threw jewels for even the smallest of things, it was thought that he had quite a lot of fortune.

'Then you'll have to pull this guy a little deeper.'

“I have found a route that is quite reliable. We need money to dig through it.”

“Where?”

“I can’t teach you that.”

After staring at the team for a moment, Zich began pouring money and valuables from the magic chest onto the table.

The money and sparkling jewels in each sack flew away in an instant. That was too much money for an individual to have.

“Are you satisfied with this?”

Tim swallowed.

'This is beyond expectations!'

At this moment, the team has shifted their mind from a simple pocket money opponent to one of the main goals of the plan.

'If you can show this amount of wealth right away, there may be more hidden wealth!'

“•••I am satisfied enough.”

"right? If so, tell me where you got the information. If you can really get the information, I can pay you enough for it, but you have to earn my trust first.”

“Will you judge that trust based on the information I have now?”

"Sure."

"great. I'm sorry, but I haven't been able to find anything like a base for the thieves. But it seems that the thieves' target has been found at a glance.”

Zich leaned forward and showed interest.

“Isn’t the purpose of raiding the merchants near the city?”

"no. it's a little bigger I think their real goal is inside the city, not outside.”

Zich looked at Tim's index finger. The index finger did not move.

in the city. Hearing this, Zich burst out laughing.

“Are you going to raid the inside of the city for one thief?”

“Once I found the information, yes.”

“Your liver is swollen.”

How dare a bandit try to attack the city guarded by the regular army, even the logistics center of Campbell. But Sieg soon thought of another possibility.

'No, is it rather that your head is spinning?'

At other times, you would have seen the ignorant act of slamming your head against a big, hard rock, laughing at them as idiots, but now the situation is different.

Since soldiers were mobilized to combat pirates, the number of soldiers deployed to Bembice was less than usual.

'Besides, the enemy forces are also going out to find the thieves' hidden beggars.'

In the end, the troops deployed to Bembice were further reduced. In this situation, if a certain size of troops and proper planning are prepared, it may be enough to run wild in the city.

'It might be easier if you have an insider in the city.'

The more I thought about it, the more likely I was to succeed.

'If you succeed, you will get a huge profit right away.'

“What is the goal? Isn't it supposed to be the city hall? Then it would be funny It's not like bandits are going to take over the city and start a rebellion. Will a new kingdom be born?”

“It’s not like that.”

'I don't have the ability to do that.'

Tim, who chewed his collaborators inwardly, continued.

“It looks like they're going to raid a place where they can make money, but I don't know exactly where. We need to get some more information.”

“And you will need money to get that information, right?”

"okay."

“Hmm.”

Zich looks worried. The team was sweet. However, he held on to it and pretended to be relaxed.

“If you don’t want to believe it, you can’t help it. If I don't pay the guard, I won't move any further. No, I can't. You can't afford to engage in risky work without money. Because my life is precious too.”

"•••great."

Zich threw the two bags of money on the table at Tim.

“One is the price for this information. Another is the expense. Is that enough?”

“No, of course!”

After giving a rough answer, he unties the straps in his pocket and begins to check the money. A smile came out of the flashing brilliance.

“The information that the thieves' targets would be in the city was pretty good. Next time you bring this kind of information, you won't regret the price."

Zich pointed to the remaining money and precious metals on the table. The team nodded eagerly.

"do not worry! I would risk my life to get information.”

“I really like that attitude!”

Zich clapped once and jumped up from his seat.

“It feels good! I'll buy you a drink! Let's drink with a crooked nose today!" alcohol. The team responded to that one word. Basically, there is no one who doesn't like alcohol. It's the same with the team.

He loved more than just likes to drink. Besides, it's not free alcohol. It's a team that often does nothing, but that's it, this is it.

"good… !”

The team that was about to agree immediately stopped talking.

"what's the matter? Don't you like alcohol?"

“No, not that… .”

The team has been sober these days. To a team that admires alcohol, the word sobriety is as far away as heaven and earth, but it was a plan for the fortress, so I was reluctant to get drunk.

In addition, it was a pity that the person drinking with him was named Jik, who was a fortune teller because he was a prey.

Alcohol easily steals rational judgment.

'Look at this guy? Does this guy stop drinking?'

Before returning, it was the team who were delighted with alcohol. There are times when he went to battle after becoming a rice cake from alcohol.

Of course, because of his personal powerlessness,

swept the battlefield while drunk

No, alcohol wasn't much of a disadvantage for him, who ran wild with instinct rather than skill when fighting.

'Do you hate alcohol at this time?'

Judging from the reaction he had when he asked to go out for a drink, that wasn't the case either.

'So you're saying you like alcohol that much, but you're in control right now?'

Of course, the team didn't always have alcohol in their mouth. There were times when he, too, was sober.

It was usually when something very important was about to happen. A time when it is so important that a person who lives by that instinct has to suppress that instinct for a while.

'That means he has a very important task ahead of him.'

And Zich didn't think it had anything to do with the thieves messing around with Bembice.

"what. Wasn’t he a weakling who could not even drink properly even though he had mastered his form like a rough man?”

Zich narrowed his eyes and scanned the team's feet from head to toe. The attitude and words made the team furious.

“You’re weak! I'm the one who's never seen a man stronger than me!"

“Is that so? But why does it look to me like a frightened sheep archer running away because he is afraid of alcohol?”

"great! Then let's go! I'll give you all of your wealth today with the price of alcohol!"

'Simple guy.'

Sieg looked at the team from behind with a pitiful look at the team as they walked out the door timidly.

* * *

When the two of them first took a seat at the bar, the atmosphere wasn't very good.

They are both taking advantage of each other, and even hiding things from each other.

Didn't Zich even make fun of Tim right before coming to the bar there?

Therefore, the conversation between the two was not very pleasant even when they first met each other with the snacks spread out.

But it was also for a while.

“Uh-huh! Did you say that?”

"then!"

Zich, who bursts out laughing out loud, and the team who raises their voices proudly. Beneath their table were already empty bottles of alcohol.

At a glance, it is quite large. However, it was not to the extent that Zich and the team, who had trained deeply, became unconscious.

But the effect was clear. If they don't get drunk, there's no need for them to enjoy alcohol.

They were just moderately intoxicated.

There are usually three things you need to make a drinking party enjoyable. Good drinks and good snacks. And a good drinking partner.

Surprisingly, Sieg and Tim were killed shortly after drinking, as if they had known each other for a long time.

“I should have seen you pee in his pants then! I was shaking, hanging from my pants crotch and begging to save my life, how funny that was!”

It should have been said that it was a saga of a team that lived as a yangachi and still lives as a yangachi.

Stories of hitting someone and intimidating someone. Ordinary people would laugh awkwardly, manage their facial expressions, or frown openly and then distance themselves from the team.

But the listener is Sieg. Right now, he is living a good life and is doing good deeds that are not in accordance with his anger, but his heart is still black.

Of course, hearing the evil deeds of the team, he sincerely laughed and laughed.

“👑👌👌👌 I would have loved to see it!”

"of course! I think I want to draw a picture and hang it inside the room.”

“Do you think that would make a great interior?”

“Is that so?”

“Okay, I’ve heard that kind of thing, but I can’t stand still.”

Zich immediately brought out his saga. The story he brought up was the story of Trislawwa of the Belid Church, who had subjugated Carwiman the other day.

Of course, I did some adaptation. It's better not to give out your own information as much as possible.

So Zich was just talking as if he was fucking a fanatic.

Besides, the only thing Zich needed was the part where he fucked Chryslaw.

“So I said! 'What are you doing? Come on! You should go and make me regret it!'”

“Are you sure you didn’t just send it off? If you let them go, they will surely hit the back of the head someday.”

“Is that possible? I've already set up all the traps on the escape route. And I said let's play a game. If you get out of the trap zone in time, they will really let you go.”

“👑👌👌👌 Really good head yes! so? How's the guy?"

“I barely made it out in time. Do you know what he said then?”

“What did you say?”

My wife won!'Yeah!”

“Ah ha ha ha ha ha!”

The team laughed as if they were really out of breath. The wine in the glass he was holding shook violently.

“That’s funny!”

“How desperate I must have been!”

"therefore? How did you respond?”

“I admit it because I am an honest person! You won!”

“And then?”

What is 'and then'?”

Zich wrinkled one eye.

“Of course, he put a knife in his chest.”

“Kah ha ha! Hahaha! Kihahahahahaha!”

The team stomped on their feet and laughed. The table thumps with a glass of wine! thud! hit

If it was any other bar, critics would have poured out around them, but the place they were drinking now was in a private room. Because of this, I was able to laugh and talk with peace of mind.

“It’s a shame! You have to see a face like that!”

"then! say it! If I had seen that face, I would not have been hungry even if I had not eaten for at least a week.”

“Is that what it was? Damn it! Why wasn't I there then!"

The team was truly sorry. And I was surprised by the feeling I was feeling right now.

'How long have you been having so much fun?'

I like alcohol, so I've always had a party like this. That's why I met a lot of drinking partners.

There was a friend who was walking down the street with me, there was a person I didn't know who I was with while drunk, and there was a woman I had a hot time with.

But I swear, this was the first time I had such a fun drinking party.

It was the same with Jack. But unlike the team, he wasn't the first. Because it often happened before the return.

'After all, this guy has a good heart with me.'

The drinking party between Zich and Tim grew as deep as the stacking bottles of alcohol.

As time passed, the noisy atmosphere disappeared and a little serious talk began to come and go.

“How did you become a sheepdog?”

Zich asked, pouring a drink into Tim's glass.

“No, no. i'll try to guess Have you been that character since birth? As soon as she came out of her mother's womb, she must have spit out swear words instead of crying! I must have shouted 'X foot!' to the midwife !”

“What kind of garbage does that happen as soon as it is born?”

It was very insulting, but the team only laughed, not angry.

“No country has superhuman abilities to that extent. rather the opposite. When I was young, no one was as docile as I was.”

"Oh yeah. That's right. So, what is the name of that fantastic world where the elves roast dragons, orcs sing peace, and gold falls instead of rain?”

"I'm not lying, you motherfucker!"

Tim giggled and raised the glass. His cup was empty. As he was about to pick up the bottle and pour it into the glass, he took the bottle’s jug in his mouth and drank it in a gulp.

“Big! Drink tastes good! Anyway, when I was a kid, I was really a nerd. Oh my gosh! Because I was afraid of this team flat fighting! A pathetic guy who will cry even if he raises his voice a little bit between his parents!”

"okay?"

Perhaps that statement is not a lie. Even though they inflate the little things they experienced as big ones, they don't make up things like that of the so-called boring times.

“But how did such an innocent boy become such a scum?”

“A lot has happened. So many things… .”

Having said that, the team didn't talk about the past any further.

(Continued on next page)

Zich and Tim really drank so much that if other people saw them, they thought, 'I'd probably die like that.'

No matter how deep your training and strong in alcohol, if you eat that much, you will inevitably get drunk to some extent.

When Zich and Tim left the bar, they were in a state of intoxication.

Where the tension in negotiating with information and money went, the two of them squeaked together and sang a song.

A song that doesn't even match the pitch or beat, literally only drunk people can sing. However, they didn't care and caused a nuisance to whatever was around them.

“Hey, Zich!”

“What, Tim!”

Now, they are calling each other's names without hesitation as if they had grown up together since childhood.

“I mean! Um - I am going to buy remind Agency form! "

"okay?"

"then! have money too! You have power too! I have a girl too! you'll have it all! Anyone who interferes with it will be slaughtered!”

“Dream big!”

“Originally, people should have big dreams! I'm going to be a tycoon!"

Becoming a giant He became one of the close associates of Zich, who was the strongest demon king among demon lords, so there is no such tycoon.

“Ugh! Then you have to work hard! Whether it’s skills, money, or connections.”

"That's why I'm working so hard, isn't it?"

After that, the two wandered the streets at night for a long time.

“Go in!”

"okay! You are  welcome too !”

Even when we parted, friendship overflowed. Do you think these two were people who were very wary of each other until someone drank?

After sending the team away, Zich walked alone on a deserted night street. The smell of alcohol permeated with every breath.

'After all, it's fun to play with that guy.'

The future is now the past. I really enjoyed drinking, feeling the nostalgia of the days of Siegmore, the demon king of power.

When he heard that the team had been subjugated by Gren Jennerd, the first emotion that Zich felt was the thought of making enemies when he drinks in the future.

But why? There was something gloomy in Zich's footsteps that permeated the night streets.

Since then, the team has often stopped by Zich for information. The size and skills of the thieves, etc. It was very useful information.

“Where do you get this information?”

“It is a secret. If you tell me your identity, there is nothing that I cannot think of depending on the amount of money.”

"done."

But Zich was convinced that the team had a connection with the bandits and could get this information.

'How could that team flat get detailed information, no matter how much money I gave you? I don't know if it's Joheim or Evelynn, this guy is absolutely impossible.'

But for whatever reason, Zich continued to receive important information from the team.

Now, aside from the thieves, the person who has the most information about them is probably Zich.

But Zich didn't even believe everything the team had to say. No, to be precise, there must have been something other than what was said.

'I'm not lying because my fingers didn't move. But he would only say what he wanted. No matter how much of a beast he is, his head will turn that much.'

And perhaps it was an instinctive thing, not a thoughtful thought.

Wolves are cunning creatures.

“So, what the thieves are looking for in the city is more than Demi, right?”

"okay."

“Your liver has come out big, you bastards.”

It wasn't as crazy as Zich's joking attack on the city hall, but the goal of the Demi-Roe business wasn't light either.

De Miro Sanghoe, which has a building that is so huge that it can be counted on one finger in the commercial district, was as huge as the size of the building.

It has a logistics network that tightly connects the Marquis of Campbell, and part of that logistics network extends to other territories, even foreign countries.

In addition, the items they mainly deal with, such as precious metals, were the things that thieves greatly liked.

'How much does it cost to shake them off?'

All the thieves will hold on to the bottom of their heads and there will be enough money to scatter.

“You still don’t know where the thieves are ?”

“He was hiding really well. I've been looking for that information first, but I can't find anything."

“Don’t give up and keep looking. I'll give you  plenty of money."

“Don't worry! Who am I! The man who will become a giant later is called Team Flat!”

“It’s enough to do the fortunes of a giant after you become a real giant, you bastard. Before that, all I could see was a bluffing blood ramiro.”

If it was the first time I met Zich, I would have run around, but the team laughed at Zich's ridicule and passed it on. It was a testament to how close the two had become.

“Anyway, was the information you gave me okay today?”

"okay. This is the best information I have ever received.”

Zich threw two jewels at the team.

"know? One is the cost of labor. Another is… .”

“Isn’t it an expense to use when obtaining information in the future? I will not scab on my ears.”

“Okay, you know. Please provide useful information in the future.”

“Don’t worry. Have I ever let you down?”

“No. Not yet.”

“There will never be.”

With a loud shout, the team stood up. In his two hands are the jewels Zich gave him.

was held tight

“Let’s have another drink after work.”

Tim, who was about to leave the room, stopped after hearing Zich's words.

"•••It's good. This time, you will live.”

“Don’t worry. Because I don't want to get it from an asshole who doesn't have money. Besides, even if you live, you won't pay. Threatening the owner to eat it for free.”

“Keuk! Did you hear it?”

In a brazen response, the team left the room.

The door slammed shut. The team is not visible. But Zich looked at the closed door as if the team was still there.

'You don't see me.'

When responding to Siek's suggestion to have a drink after work, Tim did not turn his head and looked forward.

Again in the middle of the night, the team sneaked into the company building where they were trying to shove a former pathetic colleague's subordinates.

There were no flirts like before to see if it was worth the team's uproar.

Of course, they couldn't help but look awkward because of their identities, but I didn't even expect a movement like a real guard anyway.

He walked the grounds of the Chamber of Commerce. The guards recognized him and stood up straight.

He knew for sure what his comrade would look like with his comrade's head, which had lost its body and was covered in blood with its tongue sticking out.

The team didn't care about them. The guards went up to the building used as their lodging and entered a room.

“Are you here?”

The square-faced man who had collided with the old team welcomed the team with wide open eyes.

“I’m here to tell you something about the plan.”

"Tell me."

“Most of the personnel infiltrated the city.” A man who was lying on a bed with a musty smell, biting the spout of the bottle and drinking, took the bottle from his mouth.

Stealing the strong liquor flowing from his lips into his sleeve, he revealed it and smiled.

“The time has finally come!”

“Do you know the plan?”

"Sure! I was waiting for this time even in my dreams!”

'Then you should have been managing your subordinates properly!'

But the team didn't come out of their mouths. There is nothing to gain from crashing now. It will only make your face blush.

Besides, didn't you have a special knife to catch these guys?

“I will stop doing business for a while. So I don't have any extra income any more. Do you know that?”

“That’s the word. Do I really have to?”

Tim's eyebrows twitched. But the square-faced man slowly drank his drink again and said.

“You’ve been doing well so far. I didn't even hear it. My subordinates really like it because it's good for extra income, and it's great for relieving stress. And you did your job well

He laughed cruelly.

"The order to mince the corpses very finely so that they don't know that we are a gang of bandits."

“That was the bare minimum.”

Tim walked over to him and took the bottle wildly.

“I was forced to give permission not to do that, because garbage like you will cause accidents if you stand still. Even if you can easily get out of the business as an escort, do you not understand the simple fact that there is a risk of getting caught with your garbage brain?”

"Hey. Not everything we did was in vain. They said they had no choice but to hire mercenaries because we crushed the escorts of other companies while taking such incidental statements. Our friends at that time were able to infiltrate various businesses by pretending to be mercenaries. We must not forget that contribution.”

“That was enough for me. No, it was less risky and I was able to finish it perfectly.”

“You were alone.”

“There was no need to move on such a large scale as it is now. I just need to spend a little bit where I can't cover it. I enlarged it on a large scale because of your patience like your life.”

“You didn’t even notice it moving like that. So, from now on, until the plan starts... .”

Whoops!

Tim's hand reached out towards the man. It happened so quickly that he couldn't even respond.

Where the smirk had gone so far, he widened his eyes and giggled.

“Hey, listen.”

Tim's fingers, strangling the man's neck, grew longer. His eyes gleamed and his fangs grew sharp.

“Don’t make me mad anymore. It was me who brought this plan. I also provided the weak points of the merchant and management needed for the plan. You guys have low patience, too, but I have low patience as well. I'm really in a situation where I'm doing everything I can to be patient, right? But it also has its limits. If you're wrong... .”

Wow!

The team gave more strength to their hands. The man's face turned pale.

“Maybe I can't be patient anymore. okay?" The man nodded desperately. The team roughed him up and threw him on the bed.

“Cool! Cuckoo!”

The team looked down with contempt at the man coughing and enjoying the fresh air, said coldly.

“There will be no extra income from tomorrow. If there is anyone who touches the merchants, he will die by my hand. okay?"

"Ah Okay."

He nodded, not thinking about the team anymore. Tim left the room as if he didn't want to be in a space like him anymore.

The sound of rough breathing and coughing echoed in the space where the team left.

♦ * *

It was Bembis, who was spreading anxiety due to the continuous raids of thieves, but that fear did not weigh on people's entire lives. People still continued their daily lives.

Zich stood in front of a certain kiosk. It was a stall selling various fruits. Zich picked up a fruit the size of a fist.

“You want to buy it?”

The owner of the stall was an old woman full of wrinkles.

“Only two, please.”

Zich paid the price and held the fruit in both hands. After roughly wiping the surface with his sleeve, he took a large bite. The sweet and sour taste harmonized and delighted the palate.

“Anything bad  happened?”

The owner looked at Zich's face and asked.

“Why do you have a bad complexion?”

“It’s not like that, but it’s a face with some concerns.”

“I’m looking for something, but I can’t find it.”

"okay? Is it important?”

“Yes, it is very important. It’s a matter of ties with friends.”

“Hey, that’s important. I hope you find it.”

"thank you."

That was when Zich smiled and said thank you.

There was a commotion.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 321 screen

It was a group of soldiers. The cavalry on horseback leads, followed by the infantry. And they were commanded by knights in shiny armor.

The form of marching with the gates wide open seems to go to the battlefield.

"what? Why is the army moving? Has there ever been a war?”

“Aren’t the thieves outraged again?”

“Hey, damn it! In addition?"

Anxious citizens roar. However, there was also a glimmer of anticipation.

“Is it possible that the bandits have found their base?”

" really?"

“Otherwise there would be no reason for the military to move on such a large scale. Never before had so many soldiers moved when there was an attack by thieves.”

“I wish I could!”

Citizens looked at the army going out of the castle with a crossed gaze of hope and anxiety.

But Zich had other thoughts.

'If soldiers of that size get out, Bembis' defense will become more vulnerable.'

It must be a ruse of thieves. Perhaps he purposely lured the army by exposing a place that seemed to be a base. But that's not what's important now.

Zich sensed that the day of the raid by the thieves was not far away.

'I'll have to make a decision soon.'

Zich's eyes went cold.

* * *

That night. Tim came to see Zich. He had a serious face, even pretending to look.

“I know the date of the raid by the thieves.”

"Really?"

"okay. Are you sure. I really thought my throat was going to fly off while I was looking for information.”

Tim pretended to cut his throat.

“I’m glad I took the risk, though.”

“When?”

Zich asked bluntly.

"tomorrow."

“•••Suddenly.”

“I was shocked to find out. Still, I'm glad that Where did you find out in a day or so?”

“It is.”

Zich pulled a pocket out of his pocket. It contained money and a few small jewels.

"take it. It’s a commission.”

Zich handed him a pocket.

“You don’t need to pay any more, do you? Or is there any information that I can find out more about?”

"No, there is not. The commission alone is enough.”

“Surprisingly. I thought that if it were you, I would ask for it unconditionally, saying that there is a possibility of finding out more information.”

“I’m not that conscientious.”

“Isn’t it?”

Zich showed a really surprised expression on his face.

"no no. There's no way Tim Flatt I know would say that? This child! I know it's not a team! Where did you put that motherfucker!”

“Not really, you motherfucker!”

Tim slumped into the chair across from Zich.

“I don’t even know about other guys, but I don’t want to eat my friend that much!”

"what? Did you think we were friends?”

“… Even if I give this child for mine!”

“No, this is really surprising. Did you really think of me as a friend?”

“Yes, you bastard!”

Shame, Tim said more harshly than usual. The growling seemed like it would swing his fist at any moment, so Zich didn't make fun of him any more.

“Now what?”

Tim, who had been staring at Zich for a while, hardened his complexion and asked seriously.

“You say your purpose is to kill thieves? I haven't been able to find out where they're based, but I know when and where they're going to attack, so that's probably the best time to kill them."

“I will.”

“Are you going to aim?”

“Do you think it’s possible for me to handle the bandits on my own?”

“Don’t tremble. I haven't seen you show your skills in real life, but I know you're by no means a good guy."

Zich laughed bitterly.

“Well, it is not. The scale I heard from you is enough for me to deal with alone.”

"It lines  right."

“But how big is that bandit?”

"of course! That’s the information I found hard!”

Tim shouted and tapped his chest. Zich said with a smile on his face, as if eating a joke.

“Really? Isn't that the same as saying there are more thieves to attack other companies?"

“Certainly, man! The size of the thieves is as I said, and they only have one goal higher than Demi!”

“Okay, I believe.” Saying that, Zich got up from his seat.

“I want to have a drink in my heart, but go back soon today. I have to prepare the rain.”

"OK. I get it."

The team also stood up. And he reached out towards Zich.

“Good luck, my friend.”

“Thank you, friend.”

Zich took her hand.

Tim revealed this, grinned and left the room.

' Friend... .'

Zich lay down on the bed. I looked up at the ceiling and repeated the word 'friend'.

'That guy, he didn't move his index finger when he said that.'

That means it's not a lie to say that Tim thinks of Zich as a friend.

' 👑! I like that bastard so much that I think of him as a friend after a few days of meeting him. It seems that my trashy personality hasn't changed much either.'

But Zich's silent laugh didn't last long.

'Still, the size of the bandits lied.'

The size of the bandits is much larger than what the team said, and the target of the raid is probably not just Demyro Sangsu.

'Yeah, that's right. It's a plan that includes the world's team flats. Attacking a city that is nothing more than an empty city, you end up robbing just one more? It can't be.'

Zich seemed to see the end of this plan slowly.

'They must be planning to rob the entire city.'

The defense force is small, and there are many thieves infiltrating the city. It was obvious that he was planning to confuse it with something like fire, and then do a visible foot thief.

It's a daring plan. And if it succeeds, the rumor will spread not only to this kingdom but also to the neighboring kingdoms.

'I can't let it be like that.'

Jack got up from the bed. As I told the team, I had to prepare. However, it will be a slightly different preparation than the team thinks.

The team returned to their quarters. When he came, he took the bottle he bought and poured it into a glass. After one drink, I filled the glass again.

'It's finally tomorrow.'

Unsurprisingly, the plan that has been drawn by swallowing endless patience is finally completed. After my work, he will soon have a huge sum of money.

Of course, it didn't end there. No, it's rather just the beginning. With that money, you will grow stronger and know the world


He had to become a giant.

'First, we need to create a plausible organization.'

How stressful it was to attract other thieves because there was no power. I had to share money and I didn't listen to orders.

'After the plan is complete, I will find them one by one and kill them all!'

A dark life lingered in his eyes.

But until then, I had to keep quiet. In addition, the bandits who climbed the most will die tomorrow while the plan goes ahead.

'Is he going to do well?'

Tim remembered Zich. If he felt the strength, Zich would be able to destroy the thieves.

'But even a guy will not be able to avoid the consumption of power.'

That's the moment to aim for.

They were planning to rob the entire city, but they did not intend to continue occupying the city. Bembice is also an important city in the Marquis of Campbell, so even if the current Marquis of Campbell cannot afford it, they will immediately send troops to retake it. Moreover, the number of troops still remaining in the city, even if small, is a burden.

Because of that, after plundering only at night, they were about to scatter.

Time is limited, so you need to aim for where you have the money as much as possible. And to the team, Zeek was literally a treasure trove.

He robs the places he sees and robs the jigs to get bonuses. That was the team's plan.

Although Zich is strong, the team never thought he was stronger than him. Even more so after expending power to deal with thieves.

'I'm concerned about his identity, but I don't care anymore.'

Absolutely not from the city. According to the official he took advantage of, the city had not yet noticed that the thieves were hiding in the city. If Zeek was someone employed by the city, they wouldn't know.

'And the power outside the city doesn't matter anymore.'

No matter how close the forces are, they will not be able to reach Bembis in one day.

'Even if you let the city know, you can stop reporting for a day or so.'

He has already threatened the official who caught the weakness.

'When he knew we were hiding in the city, I was really freaked out.'

Destiny was on his side, a little creaking, but the plan went as planned.

Yes, the plan.

'•••Zikra.'

With a little hesitation, the team quietly prepared for the next day.

Zich quietly looked down at the store from the rooftop of the building next to De Miro. It was late at night, so the front door of the company was already firmly closed.

A considerable amount of time has passed since the sun has set, but the attack has not yet occurred. But Zich did not move.

Most of the lights outside the building are now turned off. The number of remaining lights continued to decrease as well.

Then, suddenly, a light appeared from across the city. Did someone wake up in the middle of the night and turn on the lights?

But the fire was too big to be lit by a light.

'There's a fire.'

Zich's good eyes saw a wooden house engulfed in flames and engulfed in flames. Could the fire be caused by someone's negligence?

But the burning flame was not the only one.

There are fires all over the city. It was an obvious arson for anyone to see.

The sleeping city slowly woke up. A scream was heard in the distance, and people who were sleeping one by one got up and came out. And when he saw the flowers of fire spreading everywhere, he was terrified.

It was then that Zich moved his body.

'It's a start.'

He moved and infiltrated the building of the company. Those who should stand guard in the middle of the night are nowhere to be seen.

he wasn't murdered There were no traces of battle, not even a small blood stain.

Zich headed towards the store's largest warehouse, as if walking through his front yard.

It was the place where the guards went after the fire.

I stood in front of the door and listened.

“Hey, how much is all this!”

“Now I am rich! Rich!”

“Stop chattering and grab it quickly! Are you just going to rob me here? I don't have much time! You don't have to get out of here and go somewhere else!"

Zich raised his feet.

Whoops!

just kicked the door The large door of the warehouse was torn off its hinges and fell inside.

I saw the inside of the warehouse. A group of humans cling to a stack of boxes. A few empty boxes are rolling on the floor.

Those who were in the warehouse, and the thieves, looked at Zich with amazed eyes. Their appearance was ridiculous. He wore a bunch of rings on his fingers and several necklaces around his neck. Perhaps they were the contents of an empty box.

Jack chuckled.

“Finally got it.”

Judging from the situation, it seems that these guys were hiding under the security of the company. Usually, a trustworthy person is used for the security of the upper house, but I wondered how the thieves were disguised as a security guard, but now that doesn't matter.

The important thing is that there are thieves stealing things right in front of you.

“Hey, what is that guy?”

“Is this your first face?”

The thieves look at each other and are confused. The square-faced man who was sitting on the box exclaimed with a vicious expression on his face.

“Anyone you see is a hindrance, you idiots! Kill him right now!”

The men drew their weapons. Sieg also slowly pulled out Windur.

“I have to welcome other guests besides you.”

A lot of magical power has been injected into Windur.

“So, let’s finish it quickly.”

Zich ran towards the thieves.

(Continued on next page)

# No. 322 screen

Zich quickly clinged to the nearest thief.

The thief was terrified. He tried to wield the sword he was holding, but Windur had already dug into his neck.

Scratch!

One neck is floating. Blood gushing out like a fountain. The body, not yet aware of the absence of the head, continued to wield the sword, but Zich was no longer interested in it.

It was too easy to dodge the knife and move towards the next guy.

Perhaps because I saw one of my colleagues die, the next guy's movements were a little better.

But that's it.

The thief's sword is shattered with a sharp noise. Breaking through the fragments of the flying sword, Windur halved the thief's body diagonally.

' next.'

Zich's eyes coldly search for the next victim. You can see the figure of the thief closest to you.

looking very frightened. The swaying eyes were clearly visible.

there is no mercy Zich's Windur shot off like a flash of light.

quaang

There was a big bang. Instead of the sensation of cutting the body, I felt a strong resistance.

Contrary to the thief's ease of slashing away, Windur was blocked by a large sword.

“Who are you!”

A man with an angled face who blocked Zich's attack growled.

'Is this guy pretty good?'

The magic contained in the sword is strong. Not as easy as the ones I just killed.

I felt life behind me. Two thieves were aiming behind them.

Zich gave strength to his arm and pushed the opponent's sword. A look of embarrassment was felt on the face of the man with a square face.

'This guy! What kind of power... !'

He took a few steps back, pushed by Zich's power.

Zich swung the freed Windur fiercely. The two swords that came close to their backs bounce off at once. The chests of the two thieves were exposed.

Windur dug into the gap.

“Aww!”

“Aww!”

His chest widened, revealing his white bones and his pulsating heart.

The two thieves screamed and pressed the wounds in their chests, but the wounds were not shallow enough to be prevented by such a simple treatment. The two fell on the floor.

"this guy!"

The square-faced man jumped back in anger. The vicious mood doesn't seem too bad.

'He's definitely a strong guy.'

I thought maybe it was the head of the bandits hiding in this company.

'But that's all.'

They were stronger than the others, but at any rate, it was impossible for the wandering bandits.

chin!

Zich put his feet firmly on the ground and grabbed the sword's handle with both hands. And he swung it hard towards the man with the square face.

Aww!

The square-faced man was thrown out. Blood spattered from his hand holding the sword. His palm was torn from the impact of hitting the sword.

It's crazy!

The square-faced man flew through the wall of the warehouse and fell to the ground.

"boss!"

"what's going on!"

A sound is heard from outside. It seems that the thieves who had been robbing another warehouse after hearing the commotion had gathered.

The number of enemies increased, but Zich didn't care. I was rather happy.

'The bugs are the most annoying when they run away.'

Zich cut all the thieves left in the warehouse. And went out of the warehouse.

A man with an angular face was getting up, supported by his subordinates.

'Hmm, about 60 people.'

That's a considerable number. Besides, some of them looked pretty strong. Perhaps they are the leaders of the bandits.

But Zich still had no sense of crisis.

“Kill that bastard!”

A man with an angular face shouted. The thieves rushed and besieged Zich.

“I will give all the items in one warehouse to the one who breaks his chain!”

“Wow!”

The thieves cheered for the reward presented by the angular-faced man. Everything in one warehouse. As it is a storehouse that distributes precious metals, the amount is enormous.

At once, the scam went up. Tension and fear fly away, and desire

Only the glistening gaze looked directly at Zich.

'Of course they are thieves.'

Zich understood their gaze. At the same time, he ridiculed its stupidity.

'But I don't think the boss would have put up such a great condition for no reason.'

A man with an angular face is that much more dangerous to Zeek. However, the thieves did not have such an accident because of the huge rewards.

No, looking at their stupid sides, it seemed highly likely that they were idiots who didn't think properly before.

The thieves rushed to Zich in unison. They even competed with each other for fear of losing the final blow to their colleagues.

However, those who looked capable, including men with angular faces, did not join the group.

'Wait until I'm tired or I'm thinking of trying to find a hole in the fight.'

It's hard. The difference between Sieg and their strength is not a difference that can be filled by such simple tactics.

Zich lifted Windur.

Kaang!

He blocked the knife that came in first and cut it to the side.

Scratch!

With a greedy face, a thief was cut out.

So the real battle began.

♦ * ♦

There are corpses strewn all over the place. The floor was covered with blood, and the corpses and the weapons they were using impeded their movement.

“Whoa! Whoa!”

Jack took a deep breath. He was bleeding with swords everywhere, but it didn't seem to interfere with his movements.

Most of the thieves have been turned into corpses, but there are still some left.

“You motherfucker!”

A man with an angular face grinded his teeth. He stares at him with eyes that seem to kill him, but he doesn't approach Zich recklessly. There were too many subordinates who turned into cold corpses by Zich's sword.

'Where did this monster come from!'

But luckily the monster looked exhausted. And what's left is the executives who are the most powerful among his bandits.

'I can win!'

The square-faced man made eye contact with his subordinates. Then he slowly approached Zich.

“Die!”

A man with an angled face was the first to run. His men aided him and charged him from both sides.

All three are strong people who can use magic.

However, it was too difficult to reach Zich.

Whoo!

The sharp-faced man barely avoided the sword he drew. At the same time, the sword on the right blew out with one of Windur's blades, and then stabbed it in.

“Uh-huh!”

Windur, locked in the opponent's chest, ripped his heart to pieces without mercy. Blood gushed out from the wound.

However, without a moment of reassurance that he had killed one of his opponents, Zich jumped right away.

The sword passes by the place where Zich was standing. It belonged to the one attacking from the left.

Zich swung the blood-drenched Windur full of magical power.

Whoo!

The magical sword flew away. The sword hit the shoulder of the opponent who had not yet recovered the sword.

“Aww!”

The whole arm fell off. Extensive bleeding was seen at the amputation. If left untreated, you will die of excessive bleeding.

'There is no way that one thief would have such a potion.'

If there were, only the boss would have it.

“Hey, this kid… !”

As Zich lightly landed on the ground, the man with an angular face trembled. Now, I am truly the only one left.

Tub!

Zich took one step towards the remaining enemy. The square-faced man takes a step back.

As Zich took another step, he took another step back.

“Oh, don’t come!”

He points his sword at Zich, but the trembling of the sword doesn't seem very threatening.

Without changing his expression, Zich narrowed the distance with the enemy with a cold face.

“  Ahhhhhhhhh!”

Has your senses been paralyzed by fear? The square-faced man raised his sword high and ran towards Zich.

It was a stupid charge without any momentum or skill, literally terrified.

Zich swung Windur.

Scratch!

The sound of flesh being cut is heard, and blood splattered once more.

“Wow!”

The screams of death spread through the air. The legs of the man with an angular face as he was running slowly loosened.

dump!

he fell to the ground Blood begins to splatter on the ground. His mouth, which had been wiping his subordinates until now, did not move.

“Buck it!”

That was the last word he uttered in the world.

“Whoa! Whoa!”

Jack caught his breath. It looked as if his legs had loosened slightly as if he had moved quite hard. It looked like he was exhausted from the previous battle.

But the battle is over. It was time for Zich to take a step back, whether it was time to take care of the aftermath.

Zich hurriedly lifted Windur.

Aww!

great roar. Zich's body blew up and crashed through the wall of the warehouse next to him. The box shattered and all kinds of precious metals fell onto Zich's body.

"what? Did you stop it?”

A calm voice is heard Buried in the shards and jewels of the wooden box, Zich looked at the owner of the voice.

A wet grid appeared from a hole in the wall of the warehouse.

"•••team."

“Yeah, your friend Tim Flat. See you in one day, Zich.”

The team smiled brightly and waved their hands. It was a friendly attitude that could not be thought of as a person who attacked.

"surprised? I wish I did. It was a surprise gift for you.”

Jack didn't respond. He removed the debris from the box and got up. Seeing that, the team gasped.

“First, I was going to start by feeding him a big wound, but he was a formidable guy.”

“••• First of all, since you attacked me, can you judge me to be my enemy?”

'Aren't you surprised?'

The team looked at Zich's calm face and questioned a little. Isn't it a situation where you were attacked by someone you thought of as a friend within a short time after cooperating with yourself?

But the team kept the question down and opened their mouth.

"Sure. It's not a misunderstanding, and there's nothing behind it. I attacked you with my will.”

"okay?"

Zich pointed Windur at the team.

“It’s my advice as a friend. It'd be better if you didn't intend to fight me with the skill that takes your breath away while dealing with those little assholes. I'm just a sportsman like these guys

I'll take Lee... .”

Tim shut his mouth and hurriedly raised his arm. The day of Windur was approaching right in front of him.

'It's much faster than before... !'

Before he could finish his thoughts, Windur and Tim's arms collided.

Quang!

An unbelievable sound rang out that the sword and arm had collided. This time, the team flew in the opposite direction as before.

It collided with the wall of the warehouse next door, creating a large hole. Trapped in stacked boxes, buried in debris and precious metals.

It was the same as what Zich had suffered before.

Tub. thump.

Zich went into a hole in the warehouse. The team was nervously tossing debris and precious metals.

“As a friend, I advise you.”

Zich smirked and followed what the team had said earlier.

“You better not underestimate me. Oh, I was just pretending to be hard on purpose.”

“••• Did you pretend to be hard?”

"okay. I can't show you all my strength for nothing, so you shouldn't be scared and run away."

“Are you scared?”

Tim roared as he showed it, as if he had properly scratched his pride. But Zich was calm.

“Yeah, scared. I was already expecting you to hide and watch my battle.”

Playfully kicks a shard of a warehouse wall at his feet towards the team. The team nervously smashed the shards.

“You guys are going to attack me for my money.

I've known that for a long time, you thief, you bastard, you bastard!"

(Continued on next page)


# No. 323 screen

That was embarrassing even for the team, who had Boone all the way to the top of his head. I thought you were cheating like a fool, but you must have known about your plans for a long time.

“•••Did you deceive me?”

The team's voice is low. There was a clear sense of anger.

It can't be a funny situation. He tried to deceive Zich himself, and then expressed his anger that he deceived himself.

But he's like that, so he's a team flat. Don't think about the damage you've done to others. However, they react sharply to the damage they inflict.

“Yeah, I lied. what is that? Isn't it stupid to be deceived by something like this?"

Zich scratched the inside of the team once more.

Even Zich won't lose if his temper is dirty. I had no intention of stroking the heart of a foolish bastard who was furious about being deceived.

“That’s why if you’re going to deceive, why don’t you do it right? I was sweating as I pretended to be deceived. Even three-year-olds won’t lose a cookie from you.”

“… Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!”

The team laughed. He bows his head, shakes his shoulders, and laughs as if he were a sincere person.

"you… .”

Tim looks at Zich. The team's eyes that looked over the swaying bangs were bloody.

"die."

Koo!

The team's fists were outstretched. His body appeared in front of Zich as if he was teleporting, as if he was trying to repay the sudden surprise.

The target is the face. Among them is the chin.

Whoo!

By a single sheet of paper, Zich avoided his fist. The wind pressure caused by the fist is like a typhoon.

Zich swung Windur without hesitation.

quaang

The sword and fist collided. Both Zich and Tim took a few steps back.

"•••what is this."

Tim frowned as he looked at the back of his hand. Blood was dripping from the wound on the back of his hand.

Considering the knives and fists collided, it's surprising that it ended with just that much wound, but the team didn't think so.

“••• It looks like an asshole, but it looks like a pretty good sword.”

"right? I think so."

Zich swung his Windur as if to purify. The team revealed this.

“Do you think you can defeat me only with a good sword?”

"no."

At Zich's denial, the team felt a little better. It seems that the topic was being grasped.

But the meaning of Zich's denial was completely different from what the team had envisioned.

“Even without Windur, there is no difficulty in getting one of you. So, even if we lose, let’s not use a knife as an excuse.”

The team's face completely hardened. He smashed the floor without saying a word.

His mouth, who was not shy about ridicule and booing, was closed, exuding a tremendous amount of pressure. His fists were full of magical power and they raged like a storm.

Cuckoo Cuckoo!

A riot broke out in an instant. Knife and fist collide, sending shockwaves in all directions.

The building creaked and the precious metals that had fallen away rolled over and over. It was a sight that would scream if the owner of the store saw it.

However, he did not care about the circumstances around him as a team. He was full of thoughts of just knocking down the enemy he saw in front of him.

quaang

The team retreated to Zich's magical attack. He frowned.

'This bastard is strong!'

Zich's skills were beyond expectations. He strengthened it with magic, but his hands and arms were covered with scars.

There were also wounds that were so deep that even the white bones could be seen at first glance. But the team didn't care.

& o uh|

The wound begins to heal rapidly. The muscles tightened and the white bones were covered, and new flesh sprouted over them. Even the traces of the small wounds have already disappeared.

'The regenerative power has been great since this time.'

Seeing that, Zich clicked his tongue.

Before the return, one of the many reasons the team spearheaded each clash with another faction was its low regeneration.

He was cut, stabbed, punctured, and pierced by the enemy's attacks, but he recovered and ravaged the battlefield as if he had been injured.

Of course, I didn't just watch. He had to hit harder before his wounds healed. However, the team evaded Yorijori Zich's attack.

In the end, the team's wounds were all gone.

chin!

The team that diddge Zich's attack got off the roof of a warehouse.

He frowned as if he didn't like the situation.

'What is this!'

My self-esteem was hurt. I thought that no matter how strong he was, he was an opponent he could easily defeat. When I opened the lid, it was all me who was deceived and pushed out in battle.

But there was no anxiety. In the end, victory would be his.

“Don’t make a gloomy face, you bastard… !”

As they were about to clench their fists for battle again, the team noticed something strange around them.

"•••what?"

Look around and check your surroundings.

According to his plan, the city should be in chaos now. Flames were rising from all sides, screams of the helpless, and the vile laughter of thieves had to vibrate.

However, the perceived situation was completely different.

I could see a few flames burning the city. But there were too few of them.

Although the plan was to set fires all over the city to confuse the city. The fireworks you see now are not much different from the fireworks and numbers that started the plan.

Rather, some of the flames were extinguished to see if they were extinguished, and then they disappeared.

In my ears, I could hear shouts and the clash of weapons. It was also heard from all sides that battles were taking place here and there in the city.

As planned, there should be no or few battles. At least, the sound of battles all over the city shouldn't have been like this.

'It looks like there were defense forces left in the city!'

"curious?"

Zich's voice penetrated the team's ears. As if he had already risen, Zich was also stepping on the roof of the warehouse. Tim's fierce eyes stared at him.

“You can’t plunder the city at will, according to your plans. There were troops all over the city.”

All sorts of questions ran through the team's mind.

How the hell did they know they were going to attack the whole city? What is the identity of the troops that are still fighting the enemies? what more do you know

But one thing was certain.

That this plan, which he had put so much effort into, had failed.

“If you are curious, I can answer your questions.”

As if showing the victor's mercy, Zich said slowly.

“Of course, you should answer my questions instead. ”

"•••Questions?"

“This plan. Who wrote it?”

For a moment, Zich's expression became serious.

“It’s too detailed to be a thief’s plan.”

It is a plan that can only be crafted if you are fully aware of the situation in which the Marquis Campbell and Bembice are facing.

There must also be a weakness for the officials to use in the plan.

Is there really an information network where one thief can get enough information? Zich was skeptical.

“But it doesn’t mean that you didn’t make it. There's no way you can come up with a plan like this with your head."

"what!"

Tim growled, but Zich had no intention of canceling his words.

'In the first place, if you have such a plan ahead of you, you should prepare quietly as if you are dead. Maybe that's why Zich found the team.

But Zich understood. So it's a team flat.

“Have you ever been given a robe-clad bastard?”

At Zich's question, the team's face twisted comically. It's a face that seems to have uncovered a secret that no one knows about.

' also.'

It became clear that this plan was also the work of these guys. And at that moment, a dark cloud formed in Zich's heart.

“•••Do you know them?”

"know! Very friendly! We can't live and die for each other! So, if you have any information_ about them, please give me a little bit... .”

Zich, who was talking, stopped. He sighed once and looked at the team with ignoring eyes.

“Hey, there’s no way these guys can reveal their information to a guy like you. done. Let's just pretend we didn't ask for it."

“… Haha, you fucking bastard!”

I was so angry that the words came out rather calmly.

Doubts that had been swirling a while ago quickly subsided. All that was left was the will to kill G. Zich.

That was the time.

bang!

The front door of the Demi-Ro Company opened wildly. Zich and Tim looked at the door at the same time.

“There it is!”

A knight, dressed in flashing armor, pointed to the team on the roof and shouted. After that, a dozen soldiers rushed in.

'Those idiots!'

Zich looked at them and frowned.

'Don't interfere here!'

They were some of the soldiers who escaped the castle because of the thieves' scheme.

Seeing the soldiers going out of the castle, Zich immediately went to the mayor, thinking that there might be an attack by thieves soon.

He broke into the mayor's residence under the belief that an official with a thief might know if they met formally.

Most of the good troops were called out for war, so it was very easy to break in.

Naturally, the mayor was terrified, but Sieg's gentle threat, along with the Count's letter of introduction and Carwiman's mark of an honorary paladin, quickly calmed him down.

Zich immediately shared the information he had found. And to the mayor with a hard face, Sieg made one request.

It was the immediate return of the soldiers who had been dispatched due to the enemy's scheme.

It had been quite some time since the departure, so the mayor expressed disapproval, but Zich's ability was enough to catch up with them.

Fortunately, the market was a good match. If it didn't make sense, I would have come up with another solution, but I didn't have to.

That night. The troops who fought in the hope of wiping out the thieves' bases quietly returned to Bembice.

To hide their return, the soldiers wore their own disguise. However, the disguise of the troops, who had nothing but preparations for battle in the first place, could not be lost.

However, the late night time and darkness covered their clumsiness, and above all, the mayor was trying to hide them, so they were not caught.

The mayor was a person with his own abilities, so he perfectly checked the insiders.

All that was left was to hide the soldiers in the elements of the city.

The soldiers so prepared began to fight the thieves as soon as they started their activities.

The sound of battle resounding throughout the city was due to the fight between such soldiers and thieves.

Before the soldiers had settled in the city, Zich made one request to the mayor: Do not send troops to Demyro. It was decided that it was impossible for Bembice's troops, whose level had fallen a long way, to handle the team as the elite soldiers had escaped. There would have been only casualties.

'I did, but those... !'

Did the mayor ignore his words? No, it won't be. Come to think of it, the mayor was a really good talker.

Then there's only one thing that comes to mind.

'Blind to the ball, you disregarded orders!'

It was obvious not to see.

Soldiers surrounded the building. knight

He kicked off the ground and landed on the roof, saying, “You thief! Your evil deeds end here!”

Ignoring Zich, the knight pointed his sword at the team. Zich clicked his tongue involuntarily. The knight's behavior wasn't funny either.

But the discomfort felt by the team could not be compared.

"Hahaha! What a great day today!”

Nothing was solved, and even the garbage man saw himself and revealed it.

There is only one way to get rid of this stuffy and grumpy feeling.

Destruction!

Is it an eye illusion? The team's skin seemed to have wrinkled.

(Continued on next page)


# No. 324 screen

It was a strange sight. It was revealed to the world through the light of the bright full moon high in the sky.

The whole skin of the team is limp. It's like a lot of bugs crawling under the skin. It was disgusting, but that was only the beginning.

The team's body began to change in earnest.

He grows taller and the muscles in his body swell as if they are about to burst. His eyes turned yellow and his nails grew like beasts. The mouth protrudes long and the teeth grow sharply. In particular, the canine teeth were prominent.

The most noticeable change was the hair. Stiff silver hairs grew thickly over the skin. It looked like a meadow where grass had grown densely without a single inch of gap.

"uh?"

“I, I… !”

The appearance that is different from common sense

The soldiers were perplexed. Pointing a finger at him, he let out an embarrassment.

But it was such a shocking scene that he could not take any action. It's the same with knights. His bewildered expression reflected the shock of his heart.

But Jack was different.

Whoo!

As soon as the team showed signs of change, they jumped right into it. He knew for sure what the status of the team meant.

But the team had no intention of hanging out with Zich now. He jumped off the roof to avoid Zich's attack.

widely!

When it landed on the ground, the team had already lost most of its human form. His bright yellow eyes caught the soldiers around him.

Kwang!

A terrifying cry resounded through the hall. He rushed to the nearest soldier.

👌👌👌👌👌

The soldier did not respond. Tim's sharply sprouted nails cut the soldier's neck so easily. gushing like a fountain

A soldier's blood spilled over the team's silver fur!

Tim smiled with a face that could no longer be called a human.

“Ugh, ah ah ah ah ah!”

“It’s a monster!”

The soldiers were terrified and screamed. He threw up his weapon and began to run away to the entrance in search of a way to live.

“Hey, these guys! I can't stand there!”

The knight who rushed down the roof after chasing the team gave the order, but no one followed the order. He was just trying to run away from the fear.

But the team had no intention of allowing them to escape.

The team rushed to the soldiers. They all gathered at the entrance, so it saved me the trouble of chasing them one by one. The soldiers screamed and entangled to escape first. On the contrary, it made the share price even more difficult.

The team gets closer to them in an instant. That was the end of the soldiers' fate.

Wow! He widened his elongated snout. Sharp teeth were exposed. He bit the head of the nearest soldier.

Quad Duck!

Due to his hard teeth and unimaginable grip strength, his skull could not be pierced and crushed. Blood splattered and scattered brain water and flesh in all directions.

“Ahhhhhh!”

"help me!"

In rebellion, the soldiers stretched out their feeble fists, but that would be of no use. Hands and arms were cut in chunks by the team's forelimbs, and formidable teeth bit flesh and bones.

“I can’t stop!”

The knight ran out in anger, but it was too late. When he reached the front door, all that was left was pools of blood, splattered flesh and bones, and a ferocious monster standing in between.

“Hey, this child!”

The angry knight filled his sword with magic and rushed in.

“Die!”

The knight swung his sword with a strong spirit.

The sword hit the team's arm. However, the sword, which would have greatly increased both sharpness and strength due to magical power, could not penetrate the team's skin.

“What… !”

The article surprised me. I instinctively tried to step back, but the team's hands were faster. A hand completely covered in silver hair grabbed the knight's neck.

“Uh-huh!”

The airway is compressed and breathing is choked. The team lifted the article. The state of being changed to be 1.5 times taller than the average person . The knight hung in the air with his neck choked and struggled with his legs.

“Cuckoo!”

Still, the knight didn't miss the sword and kept stabbing the team's arm. But the team's body did not budge.

Zich clicked his tongue. I was blinded by the ball and intervened in a random place, eventually killing all of my subordinates, and I was also overpowered by the team. He was such a pathetic little boy.

First of all, Zich also tried to stop it. But the team moved too fast. If the resistance of the soldiers had any effect, even a few people could have been saved, but it was impossible for the soldiers to earn even that little time.

Zich averted his eyes from the knight and looked at the team as a whole.

werewolf. That would be the most perfect word to define the look of the team right now.

It's a familiar sight to Zich. That's what I used to do when I had to do my best before returning. That was the reason why he gave the team the nickname Werewolf.

“Hey, Zich.”

Maybe seeing the blood calmed down his anger a little? The team spoke in a surprisingly calm voice.

"what."

“Can you see this guy in my hand?”

I thought about it before returning, but with a snout like a wolf, he speaks very well. If it wasn't for my subordinates, I think I might have dissected what the decapitation mouth looked like.

“I see. What about that idiot?”

“You’re a hostage. What, shouldn't you have a troubled expression or a voice full of resentment?"

what are you talking about Zich snorted.

“Why do I have to save such an idiot?”

The knight is choking and shouts with a pale face. But Zich had no intention of listening to a language that was not even like it.

“I don’t need a guy who threw even his soldiers into the abyss of death to set up one of his balls. Well, I don't know if I have the ability to save it, but if you care about hostages when fighting you, I'm sure I'll fall behind TZ ”

that  o  ooo  j

The team let out a low laugh as if they liked Zich's words.

“Hey, Zich. I have one suggestion.”

"proposal?"

“Aren’t you going to eat with me?”

Because it was an unexpected recommendation, Zich was quite surprised.

“Originally, I was going to have you as my subordinate, but I changed my mind after seeing that your skills exceeded my expectations. If you're on my side, I don't even need money."

I was even more surprised by this statement. The world's team flats don't need money.

“Weren’t you originally aiming for my money?”

"Yes it was. I was thinking of taking the money and making him my subordinate. But after fighting, I know. you deserve it You deserve to be my collaborator. As you said, I'm a sucker for the trash, but I don't take my collaborator's money.”

That was true. Before the return, the team carried out all kinds of looting, but they did not take any interest in the property of other aides, let alone Ziek, who was a superior.

Rather, I even lent you money if you needed it! That team flat!

When Tim said things like that, it meant that Zich liked him that much.

Zich was pleased with the team's words. A close relationship before the return reached out again. How could you not be impressed with this?

And that much, Zich's heart sank in the opposite direction.

"•••great. If it is cooperation with you, it will be fine.”

“Oh, right? I know you would... !”

“However, there are conditions.” Tim, who was talking with excitement, looked at Zich. Zich hesitated for a moment. The chance that the team would accept their terms was 0% . If he puts up a condition, the relationship between him and the team will certainly flow in a hostile direction.

But Zich finally spit those words out. Because that was the driving force behind Zich's return.

“You, stop doing bad things and do good things with me.”

"•••what?"

The team's wolf face changed strangely. It's a face that said he heard a joke that wasn't even funny. He dug up to his ears to see if he had heard bullshit.

“Hey, Zich. I think I heard something wrong now. Can you tell me again?”

“Let’s do good things together and live.”

The team didn't let go of their mouths. I've heard all sorts of nonsense while being a jerk, but I wondered if this might be the best bullshit I've ever heard.

“You want to do something good? The two of you?”

"okay."

“Hey, Zich. What did you eat wrong?”

The team's question was very serious.

“A good thing? U.S? Hey, Jack. I haven't met you in a while, but I know people like you. of course. Because it's kind of like me. And we are a race far from the concept of ‘good deeds’.”

Tim waved the knight he was holding.

“Whatever it is, do whatever you want. Although there is a difference in strength and weakness, it is basically incompatible with society. Then, do you want to do something good?”

The team's eyes changed.

“My suggestion is that the two of us should destroy the world together! good thing? I didn't say this for some stupid nonsense!"

Did he feel that his proposal was insulted? The team's anger took a different direction than it has been until now. But it was clear that he was genuinely angry.

“Don’t say it again, Zich. be my collaborator Let's do 'bad things' together instead of saying 'good things' like a dog.”

Jack felt it. Perhaps that's the team's last suggestion. The life of the team descended thickly around them. He waited for Zich's answer.

"right. Obviously you and I are of the same kind. At least they're not worthy of good deeds."

Did his persuasion work? Tim's eyes softened for a moment.

But Zich's words weren't over yet.

“But you limit what I can do with just the word 'class'? Who the hell decided that?”

Jack's voice was firm.

“It doesn’t matter what kind of human I am. I decided to do good, and I just do it. Whether it's 'class' or 'race', I wonder if I know anything like that!”

Zich lifted Windur and pointed to the team. As if the previous softness was a lie, the team's momentum was rough again.

“Last offer, Tim Flat! Come and do 'good deeds' with me! Then I will take no responsibility for your previous sins, dear!”

“Girl.”

The team kicked off Zich's words with one word.

“It’s bullshit that it’s a pierced mouth. come on, got it I knew very well that you turned around like an asshole. i was crazy To think like a friend that you just met someone you just met at a drinking party.”

“Shut up!”

As if the team's anger had reached their grasp, the still-living knight made a suffocating sound. However, neither Zich nor Tim cared about the poor knight's condition.

“I’m just going to kill you as planned and take away my fortune. The plan has gone awry, but if I steal your fortune and the precious metals of this company, I'm sure you'll be fine."

“… Rejection?”

“Then did you think I would accept such an asshole offer?”

"•••okay."

Many emotions ran through my mind. But the biggest emotion among them was still confusion. But it's also awhile. Zich calmed his mind in an instant. In battle, composure is important.

“Then team flat. You must die here.”

“That’s what I’m going to say, you bastard!”

The two jumped right into each other. It was the beginning of a battle to kill each other based on thorough murderous intent.

# No. 325 screen

Zich's Windur flies straight towards the team. Windur's day shone sharply. In response, the team threw down the knight they were holding.

“Shut up!”

The knight made a suffocating sound. He was half unconscious, unable to breathe properly, but he was still alive.

Tim stabbed the knight's body, which was flying helplessly with his nails upright. It was the intention of throwing a knight to cover Zich's sight and stitching together his body as a shield.

No matter how much he said he had no intention of saving the hostage, it was because he thought he would not do anything reckless with the thrown knight because he was a 'good deed'.

It was an illusion.

Whoops!

The team stabbed the knight's body. There was a hole in the knight's body. But there was not one hole drilled.

Windur protruded through the body of the knight and the team turned around in fright.

Get a card!

Although it rubbed against his body, Windur's steel team's fur did not cause any major damage.

The damage was not delivered properly because the team evaded. But it was enough to terrify the team's back.

Whoops!

The knight's body was literally torn in the air by Zich and Tim's attack. As blood, flesh and bones rained down, Zich and Tim fell to the ground at a distance.

“You bastard! Didn't you say you did a good deed? Does that guy turn hostages into mops?”

“I should have said it before. I have no intention of taking a hostage against you.”

“Is that kind of person fortune-telling good deeds?”

“You can’t do what you can’t. People who think about things they can't do or feel guilty about are such assholes. Even if it's all good, I'm an expert at taking down villains. Rescuing hostages is slightly outside the scope of my expertise.”

“Where in the world is such a good man!”

“I said I was doing good, but I never said a word about being a good guy. I am the bad guy.”

'What kind of nonsense is there!'

Tim admits that he is a very selfish person.

But in front of me, compared to the guy who claims to be a bad guy who does good things, he started to think that he might be a good guy.

“You understand! The good things I do are not the right things for ordinary people to see! It's just that the target of a bad deed has become a villain! That's enough, you can do it too!"

Zich once again convinced the team. But the team shook their heads.

"That means don't touch the humans, not the bad guys."

I can't.

“Why do I have to do that? In the world, it is natural for the strong to eat and the weak to eat. Substitute good and evil into it to choose a prey? ha ha! What kind of a good wolf would do such a damn thing!”

“When we talked at a drinking party before, didn’t you say that you used to be such a weak person too?”

“Yeah, it was.”

Others may remember the past as faded but beautiful memories. But for the team, the past was just a shame they wanted to erase.

“When I think of the damn weak me back then, even when I was sleeping, I had a fever that made me want to kill someone. If the past me appears in front of the present me, I will kill him without hesitation.”

Even louder than Zich had ever felt, the team was expressing their anger. Perhaps the most hated being for him seemed to be his past self.

“There must have been a lot of events until you, who was weak in the past, changed to what you are now, right?”

"okay. It is a story that cannot be heard without tears. Those were very difficult cases. But I got over it! I threw away my weak self and was reborn!”

Tim spread his arms wide. And, as if proclaiming to the world, he shouted out loud.

“I am strong!”

There was a pride that could not be hidden in his voice.

“And the power must have been given to them by some suspicious robes in their robes.”

"okay. I don't know how you know that, but it's true. But the power they gave was only an opportunity. It is me who refines that power and uses it to perfection.”

“What if the events you went through were also caused by those robes?”

"•••what?"

The team's triumphant expression collapsed in an instant.

“I am chasing them. They're the ones who corrupt people by picking up one person and causing all sorts of unfortunate events. And make him a villain. Just like you now.”

“You have changed according to their intentions. Looking at you now, their plans must have been very successful.”

Although Zich continued to speak, the team did not say much. Zich's words seemed quite shocking.

“I am doing a good job, but right now my most important target is them. Why don't you go after them with me?"

Zich held out his hand again. His tense eyes stare at Tim.

"•••I do not need."

The answer returned was disappointing. Zich clenched his fists.

“Can’t you believe me?”

“No, believe me. To be honest, these guys, I thought, were very suspicious. You deserve to have a plan like that. When I think about it again, the timing that gave me strength was also very good.”

Tim looked at Zich.

“But holding hands with you is a different story. those guys? it's annoying! To be honest, I want to tear it apart right now! But it's enough for me to find them and rip them apart! To hold hands with you and live like a tamed bastard? Those are the specifications!”

“Yeah, that personality was made by them too.”

"I do not care! Whatever the process, this is who I am now!”

Jack sighed. He's also the guy who gets along the best with him. Even the old fashioned way was similar.

Whether someone manipulated the path of the past or not, Siek and the team admit to who they are now.

In addition to that, no matter the outcome, he has a will to kill all those who played with his life.

Jack knew for sure.

'It's impossible to convince him.'

After knowing that the team's personality was the same as before the return, the constant anxiety hit me.

'He was finished by the robes.'

With a glimmer of hope, I went looking for the robes in the city.

Judging by their track record, if the team hadn't completely fallen, they'd still be hovering around the team and causing events.

But Zich couldn't find the robes. Unlike Yoheim and Evelynn, the team had been completed as a mineware wolf.

“Yeah, I got it.”

Zich has decided to respect the team's decision. No more persuasion.

All that's left is a battle that forces each other's thoughts.

Tim lowered himself as if he knew Zich's intentions. It looked like a wolf stalking its prey.

Tuoung!

Zich and Tim ran into each other. Windur and the claw collided.

quaang

The recoil bounced off Windur and his claws. However, the two pressed their feet firmly to the ground to prevent their bodies from being pushed out.

bang! bang! bang!

Cut, scratch, slash and stab. In an instant, dozens of consensus workshops came and went.

Windur's grotesque blade danced, and Tim's sharp claws ripped through the space.

Whoo!

The team blew the knee. Because he was so big, his knees easily reached Zeek's face.

If it's right, it won't end up to the point where the nose bone collapses.

quaang

Windur's day blocked the team's knee.

Tuk!

The team jumped with the other foot on the ground. As it was, he circled around the air and kicked Zich. He also had sharp claws on his feet.

Zich leaned back to avoid the attack. Feet covered in silver fur passed right in front of his face.

Dodge leg attacks twice. As long as even werewolves are bipedal, it is unlikely that any more consecutive attacks will be possible.

But Zich was not vigilant. He knew the way the team fought before the return.

quaang

The tail falls to the ground where Zich retreated. The traces made by the seemingly fluffy tail were enough to suffocate the hair bones.

“Shit! avoid it?”

The team kicked the tongue as if it was a confident attack.

Zich swung Windur again. A team that landed on the ground and skillfully balanced it intercepted.

Another fierce battle ensued. By this time, the two were able to guess the skill of the other to some extent.

The team grinned.

'After all, this guy is weaker than me!'

When he was in human form, he was pushed back, but when his original power was revealed, the situation was reversed in an instant. In most aspects, such as strength, speed, etc., the team had the upper hand.

Zich also frowned slightly.

'Was it completed to this extent?'

The wrist holding the sword throbbed. Even though Sieg is getting stronger at an amazing speed, there was a sense of power against the well-formed Weulf.

But Zich didn't care.

The charter began to flow into the team's dominance. After a while, it looks like the end of the game will come down to victory for the team.

The team thought so too. In order to catch the victory even a little faster, he pushed Zich even more fiercely.

But after a while, the team was forced to contort their faces.

'Why doesn't this guy fall down!'

No matter how many times he hit and kicked, his attack was stopped.

Obviously, his attack is strong. Zich's bizarre sword that blocked his attack was pushed little by little.

But that's it. The team hasn't hit Sieg so far.

'Oh no, I can't do this!'

It's like hitting a reed. Even if the body is laid down by a strong attack, the image of raising the body again is imprinted.

“Damn it!”

The team attacked harder. The center of gravity was moved forward and the weight was carried more strongly. The power of each one increased.

Zich's defense is pushed back little by little. It was time for the team to laugh.

Scratch!

Windur, who had dug under his arm, brushed his side. Steel-like hair was cut and tough leather was torn.

Push!

Blood spattered from the wound.

“What!”

The team was astonished.

'What the hell!'

Obviously, it was he who was leading the battle to an advantage. But it was he who saw the blood first.

“What a dog!”

The wound is nothing. If it were someone else, it would have been enough to hinder his actions even if it wasn't a serious injury, but he has a powerful regenerative ability. His wounds had already faded.

But an incomprehensible situation drove him into confusion.

And chaos is never a good thing in combat.

'I got it.'

Seeing that the team's attack had become blunt, although a little, inwardly, he nodded. Obviously, the team had the upper hand in physical ability, but Zich has the experience he had before returning. Besides, his opponent is Tim Flatt, who was close to him.

He knows all too well how he fights.

Even if it was suitable for the match, it easily crossed hundreds of times, and the number of people on the battlefield together cannot be counted.

Moreover, even though the body is complete, the team's movements now are clumsy than the team's movements before the return.

Therefore, Zich was blocking the team's attack more easily than expected.

'And a guy of this age would be more easily excited.'

It was Zich who fixed that redness. Of course, I was well aware of the habit of being excited.

“Ahhhhhhh!”

I can't stand the minute and the team attacks like a storm. On the other hand, Zich's eyes were very cold.
