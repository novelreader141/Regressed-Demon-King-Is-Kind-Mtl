Zich thought It doesn't matter him even if Glen regressed. I came to that conclusion.

But it doesn't seem like he has returned. So it was concluded.

But this time I had this thought.

'Isn't there a situation where he's also returned and he doesn't know what he said to me?'

He shook his head.

'I did a regression, but what if the point at which he returned is not the same as mine?'

It was a blind spot. If he naturally returned because of his own experience, he thought he had done it at the same time as himself, in the final battle.

'No, wait. I can't really conclude that he has returned.'

Now, among his colleagues, there are people who have not returned, but know all kinds of future knowledge. Of course, I have lost most of my memories now.

'Is it like Lyla?'

Then there was a possibility that Glen Zenard was related to those assassins.

'If so.'

His face hardened.

Assassins ( Black Robes ) are making Demon people on the continent. And the one who killed the Demon People the most was Glen Zenard, the 'Dragon of the Sun' ( Sun Hero ).

If the two are related in any way.

'Hypocrite.'

It was the thought that popped into Zich's head.

'Maybe mining for his own fame?'

Zich crossed his arms and patted his feet.

'I'm sure it's too far-fetched.'

But given his experiences, there is no guarantee that such a madman will not exist.

>'I'm a guy who does all sorts of things to fuck people, but it's funny to conclude that there's no one who makes Demon people because to raise his reputation.'

Zich was a person who could see himself objectively.

But it was too early to say so.

'There may be other reasons.'

It could be someone who ran away from a bunch of assassins, like Lyla.

Zich shook his head at the branch of doubt that continued to expand.

'There are too many possibilities.'

If he also regressed like Zich, it is highly probable that the regression is different from Zich's regression at any point in time or whatever.

If he knows future knowledge like Lyla, there's a good chance it has something to do with the assassins.

'If it has to do with regression, maybe he knows how to regress.'

Even if Glen made a comeback, the reason Zich didn't really care was because he thought he had the same conditions as him.

In other words, if he also did a regression, he thought he did it because of the 'key that twists fate'.

However, if the regression was performed at a completely different point in time, the reason might be different.

'Maybe you know the reason or method of the regression.'

And that's one of the reasons why Zich is traveling now.

'He may be conspiring with the assassin.'

Zich's eyes sharpened.

'Catch him and kill him?'

If it was the time when he was a Demon King, that would have been the case. But the Zich of today were not Zich Moore. And above all, there were people who hated Zich becoming the Demon King.

"Huh? What happened?” When Lyla came back from shopping, she saw Zich and Hans out in the back yard and asked.

“It’s no big deal. I'll tell you in a little bit."

"Okay."

Lyla nodded lightly and entered the building. Singing even a light hum, seems to have been a very satisfying shopping experience.

'Well, okay. Nothing is for sure yet, so let's leave it alone for now. No, I think it's an advantage, isn't it?'

Zich smiled.

'Whether it's related to the regression or the assassin, you've found something similar.'

In addition, if Glen is really 'a person who created a Demon People for his own fame', he should approach it more carefully.

'If that guy really made demons for his feat, it means that he led me down the path of the Demon King.'

Then Glen was A man who manipulated Zich's life to his will.

'Then I should treat him generously.'

Incomparable to the other guys I've been fed up with so far, each and every one of them was meticulously done.

Hans, who was going to continue training by pulling Estelaide again, flinched when he saw Zich's face.

'What are you thinking again?'

I've never seen the person who was the target of that laugh look good. But Hans soon turned his attention.

'But I've never seen the person who was the target of that laugh be innocent either'

He started training again, wielding Estelaide. However, he felt deep compassion for the object in Zich's head.

Zich smiled.

The current thoughts do not exceed the expectations of conjectures to the last. There is no evidence or clues, and it is just a line that says 'it may be so' if you look at the circumstances.

'If anyone hears it, it's just a delusion that will make you snort.'

But it is also worth noting.

'Let's find out about this guy first.'

Zich took out the Windur he was carrying.

A sword with the 'key to twist fate', the number one item who brought him back to the past.

'This guy and the strange tree in the ancient ruins resonated.'

And she said that the odd tree might be known by Leona's grandmother. Because of this, I want to try to go to Leona's hometown to recognize the tree.

'I have one more reason.'

Zich tied Windur back to his back. Then, leaving Hans training behind, he headed into the building.

'By the way, if Glen was really such a mean bastard, the last thing he said to me was... .'

The face of the guy who said to himself, 'When you are born again, live a good life' is vivid.

Those remarks that showed respect for the power that overcame him and made him choose to live a good life this time.

'But if he's the one who ruined my life, if he's a hypocrite, how am I supposed to accept that?'

Like a hero, I thought he meant it sincerely, but if he really was a hypocrite, there was a high probability that it was just nonsense.

'The words of that guy... Should I follow?'

Whoops!

Someone grabbed his sleeve.

“Zich!”

It was Lyla.

It was as if he had just entered the building.

She was holding him as she came down to the lobby after she had packed her shopping loot from her room.

Her face was pale, as if she had seen a ghost.

"Huh? What's up? What's going on?”

Zich asked. Lyla hurriedly looked at his face. Zich furrowed his eyebrows.

"what. Why?”

“••• Whoo!”

Without answering Zich's question, she sighed.

“I take a deep breath when I see someone else’s face in a bad way. What's wrong with this handsome face?"

Zich wiped his cheek once.

"no. It’s not like that.”

She would have been sarcastic about her usual 'handsome face' rhyme, but when she backed away, Zich looked more suspiciously at her.

But Lyla waved her hand saying it wasn't an extension.

“It really doesn’t matter.”

“Is that so?”

Zich turned his attention to her, who didn't want to talk much.

“Then I go up. Oh, I’ll tell you about it in a little while.”

"okay. It's enough for me to do it while I'm eating." Zich walked up the stairs.

Lyla, who continued to stare at his back until his figure disappeared completely upstairs, slumped into a nearby chair.

It was as if her legs had lost strength. He embraces his arms and even trembles.

'•••That  face.'

When Lyla came down to the lobby, I saw the faces of Zich, she attached a heart frozen lines  found.

His face was engulfed in thought.

a familiar face But it was also an unfamiliar face.

'That's... that face is obviously... !'

for a while The face disappeared as soon as he grabbed his sleeve.

However, that face was clearly positioned in Laila's few memories.

'It was the face of Siegmore.'

Why did Zich have the face of the Demon King even for a moment?

She buried her face in her hands.

Glen and Browning slowly left the house.

There were a lot of people around the house. All of them were onlookers who came to see the heroes who saved the city.

Glen glanced at them once, and Browning spoke up next to them.

"how was it?"

"What?"

“It’s the people who are the warriors. You've met two of them."

“It wasn't bad. A man named Zich already knew. Even a person named Hans seemed to have a clear view of justice.”

"right?"

Glen looked at Browning. She had a very bright face.

Glen remembered the conversation she had with Hans.

“Come to think of it, Browning had a conversation with him too.”

"Huh! I was a little reluctant at first because he was a member of the group we had an argument with, but when I talked to him, he said he was a pretty good person. I can speak.”

"Is that so?"

Browning told Glen the conversation between her and Hans. Glen listened intently to her conversation with a smile on his face.

No, he seemed to hear it.

“You seem to like it quite a bit.”

Meaningful words came out of his mouth.

But Browning just nodded.

“It was a good meeting after a long time.”

“It’s nice. But, Browning. Have you ever thought about swords and shields?”

“Ah, that… .”

Browning smiled awkwardly and turned his head.

“Ah, yet… .”

"Fine. Isn't that an important issue? But be careful not to take too much time.”

“Yes, I will.”

Since then, Glen has been silent. In the frozen silence, Glen thought about Zich.

'Siegmore. It's definitely weird.'

This time, I approached them and confirmed and convinced them.

No matter how often the world changes unpredictably, it has changed so much.

'Why did the tyrant of the earth and Leona become his party? Why does his party have 'Estelaide'?'

That's not the only thing.

'The existence of Siegmore has changed too much. Now is not the time for him to have such a rough personality yet. No, I should still be wallowing in Count Stillwall.'

And after a while, you have to enter the path of the Demon King.

But, what is the current situation? Far from being a demon king, he is rather called a hero. He even had the title of 'Karwiman's Honorable Paladin'.

'Rubella also seemed friendly with that guy.'

She was always serious and careful in everything she did, even 'fucking jokes' and hanging out with him.

This was the first time such a change occurred.

For this reason, Glen had no choice but to carefully think of one possibility.

'Did he even make a comeback?'

At first, I thought that the being that Zich was talking about had changed him. However, can the existence of just one person 'distort' the world to this extent?

If not, there is a possibility that there will be another regressor.

But after thinking for a while, Glen shook his head.

'no. I can't.'

yes it can't be

'This special power.'

This power that makes you special, 'because no one else can have it.'

To the last, the only thing 'special' is 'you'.

With that thought, Glen erased the small doubts that rose from his mind.
