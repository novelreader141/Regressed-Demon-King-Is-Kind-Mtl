No. 189 Tuesday

Scratch!

The chair hits the floor. Leona's face turned pale like a corpse.

“That, that,  that… what… .”

Lyla, who was next to him, took her hand to calm Leona.

The atmosphere at the table suddenly became cold. Hans and Snock, unaware of the circumstances, rolled their eyes.

I understood that Leona's family was being held captive, but an unfamiliar word came out and interfered with my understanding.

“Did I say that the elven kingdom is different from the human kingdom?”

Zich started explaining to the two of them.

“The elves of the Adrowon Great Forest are divided into several clans. The 'iron clan' I just mentioned is probably one of them. You can think of those clans as the kingdom of humans. And the kingdoms of the elves are forming a union. Of course, it is different from the United Kingdom of humans. Much looser.” Hanson and Snock paid close attention to Zich's words. Deniel looked at Zich with a very surprised expression.

“Still, as it is a coalition, we communicate with each other to some extent. One of them is the so-called 'Puola', a request for a consultative body. The king can make a declaration of any clan, and then the royal families of the united kingdom gather in a neutral zone called 'mentis' and have a meeting.”

“You know it well. None of the human beings know the society of our Adro-One Great Forest Elves.”

Daniel was amazed. But he wasn't just admiring. That's how limited it was.

Humans and elves were on the slightly worse side in terms of good or bad.

However, as the people in front of them knew their social image, it was natural to be wary.

“Because I had a chance to know before.”

Zich smiled and said so. But in reality, he didn't say anything with a smile like that.

'I had a good time with you guys.' At that time, Zich and his subordinates were really fighting against everyone without making a joke. Among them were, of course, elves.

I also learned things like the basic society of elves at that time. To be precise, the subordinate had informed me.

'By the way, I think I've heard of the 'Iron Clan'.'

Zich stammered his thoughts. But I didn't immediately remember.

'I'll think about it later. For now, we're talking.'

Zich continued the rest of the explanation to Hans and Snock.

“If you listen to the story, it can be said that the king of the 'iron clan' declared 'puola', and the king and wife of the Leona clan and the shaman went to Mentis and were imprisoned there.”

After completing the explanation, Zich looked at Danielle.

“Is it okay if I understand this?”

“You are correct. Even if I explain it, I can’t explain it any more.”

“If it is the ‘Iron Clan’ who declared ‘Puola’, then there is a high possibility that those who are now imprisoning His Majesty’s party are also them.”

"Yes. Mentis is said to be occupied by the army of the 'Iron Clan'.”

"Why?"

Leona, who was leaning on Laila, got up as she hit the table. The dishes were rattling.

“Why did they do that?”

“They asked us to obey them.”

"What are you talking about! It is the principle of unity that each clan recognizes each other as equals!”

Leo My face turned red.

“Do you have any reason?”

Zich asked.

“Something that demands obedience or something like that. Or did it really happen for no reason at all?”

“•••There is a good cause, but it is a nonsensical reason. No matter how much I think about it, it doesn’t seem like they’re just trying to make a fuss.”

'You're turning.'

The justification seemed to be really scolding, but he didn't seem to want to say so.

Zich did not miss the moment Deniel's gaze went to Leona for a moment.

“Is it because of ‘tears of the lake’?”

Leona turned her face away, and an embarrassment appeared on Deniel's face.

He sends a reprimanded look at Zich. It also meant not to say any more.

But Zich ignored those eyes. Rather, I looked at him as if to tell him the answer.

“Is that true? Was it really because of 'Tears of the Lake'?”

My parents are imprisoned because of the clan's treasure stolen as a joke, and the war is on the brink of war. Leona's voice trembled.

Deniel stared at Zich strongly. And quickly comforted Leona.

“Again, this is purely arrogant. 'Tears of the lake' are our family's treasure to the last. They have no reason or right to care. Whether we destroy it or throw it away, or if we let it be stolen, is our business, and they have no right to intervene.”

But Deniel's words didn't seem to revive Leona's energy. Her hands were trembling.

It was time for Deniel to calm Leona again.

“Whoop!” Leona suddenly took a deep breath.

“Uhhhhhhhh!” and exhale I repeated that a couple of times.

“•••So how is the situation?” His voice is still trembling. The convulsive hands are the same. However, De Niel saw Leona's eyes trying to move forward in the midst of it.

“I do advise.”

said Zich.

“Don’t look at Leona now like the woman you knew. She has been through some great things too.”

“•••It seems so.”

However, that does not mean that Leona has become a character such as a master of reversal or a charismatic leader. Her body, which is still trembling, proves it.

However, even though he felt that he was suffering because of him, the spirit of trying to move forward somehow made Deniel very satisfied.

Indeed, this trip seems to have been of great benefit to Leona. Daniel raised the evaluation of the thief who stole 'Tears of the Lake' once again.

Death doesn't mean anything.

“There is no sign of anything happening right now. The military tension is tight, but it has not yet been put into action. Still, I can't be sure what's going to happen if something happens somewhere, whatever it is."

Daniel's words became more comfortable.

“Who is leading the clan now?”

“This is Dronian-sama.”

“Your brother?”

Leona was surprised, but soon understood. If the king, queen, and shaman were captured, all that was left was her brother, who was the next heir to the throne.

“Fortunately, Dronian-sama is a smart man. However, as the situation is the situation, there is no choice but to limit the movement.”

In a big way, the king and queen of a country are being held captive by an enemy country, and in a narrow way, the lives of their parents are at stake.

“Once I’ve been looking for ‘Tears of the Lake,’ how can it be solved?”

“It will be a crowd.”

Deniel said, and Zich agreed.

“If these guys are really making a fuss, they'll get another one right away. Even if it comes to mind right away, 'I can't entrust you with 'Tears of the Lake', so give them away' or 'I can't trust you who have stolen 'Tears of the Lake' by humans, so obey."

“You are correct.”

“… What is it." Leona murmured in anger. But I couldn't help it. Because twitching is like that.

Zich said to Daniel.

“So the residents were nervous. You never know when there will be a war.”

"Yes. Besides, since this is the place closest to human forces, there will be concerns that humans will invade if the power is distributed to other places.”

Daniel looked at Leona.

“Nevertheless, the princess came back with 'Tears of the Lake,' so it's all good. At least I have one less thing to worry about.”

“I’m sorry, Deniel.”

"Fine. To be honest, looking at the current princess look, I am satisfied enough as an individual. You have grown up so well.”

Daniel smiled.

“Get a good rest today and go up to the capital tomorrow. I would like you and your friends to go up there too. No matter how bad times are, they are the ones who protected the princess and even helped her recover the 'tears of the lake', so the treatment will not be bad.”

“Is Danielle still here?”

“No, Princess. If the princess returned, she was also tasked with guiding them to the capital. We can take you to the capital.”

Leona nodded happily.

After finishing his duties, Daniel said goodbye and left the house.

Leona sighs. Lyla, who was constantly exposing Leona next to her, asked.

" it's okay?"

"yes I'm fine. Thanks for the comfort, Lyla.”

Clearly, her expression is more relaxed than before. It seemed certain that he had captured his heart to some extent.

“How many clans are in the Union?”

Zich asked. Lyla opened her axe's eyes and looked at him as if she had to ask him now. However, Leo I calmly solved Zich's curiosity.

“A total of five. In addition to the 'iron clan' mentioned earlier, there are 'lake clan', 'mountain clan', 'sea clan' and 'plain clan'. We are 'the clan of the lake'.”

'So the treasure is 'tears of the lake'?'

He patted his chin, thinking inconsequentially.

'Now, what do we do?'

The plan to take Leona and ask Leona's grandmother about the 'upside down tree' and go on a tour of the elf country was completely ruined.

Zich had to decide which way the party would go from here.

Or just take Leona and go their own way... .

'Would you like to participate in a war that is likely to happen soon?'

Zich recalled the war before his return.

'That was good.'

A space where strength, heat, fighting spirit, screams, sorrow, and death coexist.

After the return, there were several fights, but I did not experience anything worthy of being called a war.

It was most similar to when they wiped out the northern branch of Valid, but at that time, Zich didn't run into a riot in the temple rather than jump into the battlefield.

Maybe it was because he knew that Glen Zenard wasn't the champion of justice he knew.

Although he was unaware of it, Zich was now more focused on 'war' than on 'good works' he had been insisting on.

like a demon king.

'By the way, I think I heard at first glance that that guy, Glen Zenard, was involved in the elven war.'

Clearly, the story flowed in such a way that the elves of the Great Forest of Adrowon had freed them from being oppressed by some.

'The names of these guys are clear... .'

For a moment, Zich remembered one thought that had been delayed earlier.

"The Iron Clan' That's right, it was the 'Iron Clan'.'

Zich's finger tapped the table. Then, suddenly, I asked Leona.

“By the way, Leona. Is Leona's grandmother okay?"

“No, the shaman who said he was imprisoned with his father and mother earlier. She is the grandmother.”

Leona said sadly.

But on the contrary, Zich's eyes gleamed.

'This, probably. Guess I'll have to go to war.'

And Lyla, who was reading Leona, was looking at Zich with concern.
