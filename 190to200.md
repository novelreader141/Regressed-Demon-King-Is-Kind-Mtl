The next day, Zich and his party started going up to the capital under the guidance of Deniel.

The village of the elves he stopped by from time to time was not so different from the village he had seen for the first time. However, often large villages appeared, and there were also residences that could be called a city.

In particular, when they saw how large and thick trees were woven together to make a huge fortress wall, everyone was amazed.

After walking through the great forest for a while, a huge city appeared incomparable to what it had been before.

“Wow 〜]”

Snock burst out in admiration. The other people showed a sign of admiration, only to a different degree.

You can see the city spread out below the ridge. It was such a beautiful city that was foreign and unfamiliar, different from the human city.

The city bordered on a large and beautiful lake.

An elf-specific wooden wall surrounded the city, but it did not extend to the part facing the lake.

Thanks to the natural topography of the lake, the part where the city and the lake bordered did not need a wall.

>The name of Leona's clan was `The Lake Clan`.

I knew right away why it was called that.

“This is Draud Shurin, the capital of our 'Lake Clan'.”

Daniel introduced the city.

Zich nodded, remembering Leona's full name.

The elf's surname is the name of the forest it came from. And Leona's official name is 'Leona Pearl in Draud'. The name indicated that he was from this city.

It was unfamiliar to humans to introduce a city as a forest, but it was a natural idea for an elf.

Moreover, to call it a forest did not make sense at all.

Everything from the wall to the house where the elves lived was made of living wood.

“And that place is our home!”

Leona pointed to a large building in the center of the city.

They were all elven buildings located on tall, thick trees, but the building in the center was built on taller, thicker trees.

There are a total of seven trees supporting the building. It was like opening a palace floating in the sky.

If it was Princess Leona's house, it would be a royal palace. It was a building that was as special as its unusual appearance.

However, there was one thing that seemed even more special about the droud forest.

“What is that?”

Zich pointed to the part of the lake right next to the droud forest.

Another building stood there.

A building built on a huge tree that protrudes above the surface of the lake. Its scale was not much different from that of the royal palace in the middle of the city.

A bridge, like a living tree, crossed the lake, connecting the city and the buildings.

“It is the ‘altar’. It is a place where you can communicate with the spirits around you. It is also the place where 'Tears of the Lake' lay.”

Deniel looked at Leona and said. Leona, who was stabbed, averted her gaze.

Zich's group entered the droud forest. Since they were quite used to the city of elves, they no longer looked around in a strange way.

There was also a sense of tension in the atmosphere of war.

Daniel led the party to the front of the palace. A stairway was made to go up by rotating on a wooden pole. They climbed the stairs and entered the palace.

The inside of the palace was as large as it looked from the outside.

Elves walking around the palace greet them.

Despite the presence of the princess Leona, they only bowed their heads slightly, and did not show any exaggerated examples beyond necessary.

"Excuse me."

Someone came to them. He was an elf with a profound impression with a white mustache.

As an elf with a long lifespan and slow aging, it was telling that he was of considerable age.

“Freed!”

Leona called out the old man's name aloud. That old man called Fried looked at Leona and admired it.

But the moment was short. He soon made a solemn face and spoke quietly to Leona.

“Are you back, princess?”

"Huh! brother is?"

“I am waiting inside.”

Fried's gaze ran over Leona's body. I'll check to see if there are any injuries. He looked like a grandfather who was worried about his granddaughter.

Fortunately, there were no major wounds on Leona's body.

Fred sighed in relief. But it was not expressed outwardly. Rather, he hid his expression even more.

“Are you with the princess? My name is 'Free de will droud'. Even though he lacks a body, he is in charge of the management of this royal palace.”

He looked at Zich and said hello. Zich's group also greeted him face to face.

“I heard that you protected the princess and helped find the 'tears of the lake'. As one of the members of 'The Clan of the Lake', I would like to express my deepest gratitude to you.”

He bowed deeply to Zich's group.

“Come in. The prince is waiting for you.”

Fried turned to guide the party.

“Oh, and Princess.”

He turned his head slightly and looked at Leona.

“After you see the prince today, talk to me.”

His expression did not change, but the atmosphere could never be said to be mild. Leona swallowed her saliva.

“•.•Are you going to be angry?”

"of course."

Fried said in a quiet voice.

Leona's shoulders dropped. But no one helped Leona. No, I couldn't.

Who is going to interfere with the education of the princess who ran away after an accident?

“Of course, my turn is next to the prince. The prince is also greedy, so it will be a little too late for you to come to me.”

Leona fell from her shoulders to her head.

Fried looked at Daniel.

“You worked hard to bring the princess and her companions up to here. I've prepared the lodging for you, so you're good to go."

"Yes!"

Deniel answered vigorously and bowed his head toward Leo and Zich and the others. Then, following the guidance of an elf who was waiting next to him, he disappeared from view.

“By the way, they say that Daniel has been demoted.”

Leona asks. But Fried shook his head.

“I have nothing to say about him. I don't even have authority. Please ask the prince everything.”

“… What about your father, mother, and grandmother?”

“… Yes."

He tried not to show it, but the answer that he answered seemed very complicated.

Fried led Zich and his party into a room.

It was a fairly large room. Two thick trees protruding out of the floor, towering on either side, pierced the roof.

Branches and leaves extending in all directions embroidered the ceiling like a colorful chandelier.

Opposite the entrance from which they entered, an altar rose. And on top of it were two large chairs.

It was the throne of kings and queens. And a little in front of the throne, under the pedestal, there were two more chairs on either side.

I saw an elf standing in front of the chair, holding the back of the chair. He turned his head toward Zich's group.

"brother!"

Leona ran towards him.

He looked at Leona and smiled brightly. She spread her arms out as if to hug her right away.

Without hesitation, Leona also spread her arms out wide.

The two seemed to hug each other. If only the elf, who was smiling at Leona, had not suddenly raised his fist high.

taak

“Aww!”

At the sound of a loud blow, Zich and his party flinched. Leona grabbed her head and sat down. It felt like his head was spinning in a fist that hit the top of his head.

"what are you doing!"

Leona just raised her head and shouted at the elf. Tears welling up in the corners of his eyes looked quite painful.

However, the elf who had grabbed Leona didn't care.

Rather, where the smile from earlier went and gave a very bad impression, Leona shrugged her head.

“You don’t know how to greet me with a kind smile, saying, ‘Come here!’, you stupid little brother!”

And he looks like he's waving his fist. Leona shook her head slightly. But he opened his mouth again as if he had something to say.

“Ho, 'Tears of the Lake' has arrived... .”

"what'?"

But when he saw his older brother's eyes glaringly blue, he closed his mouth again.

After looking down at Leona for a while, he sighed deeply.

“Do you know how worried we were?”

"Eww… ”

Leona had nothing to say. It is because the deep concern and love were conveyed through the voice of the older brother.

"Sorry."

She humbly utters an apology. The prince sighed heavily.

I looked down at my depressed brother. His face was still frowned upon, but there was an irresistible love in his eyes.

“… came back fine though. I'm glad that there doesn't seem to be any serious injuries anywhere."

"Huh!"

Leona replied loudly.

The prince, who raised Leona from the runner, looked at Zich and the others.

The prince approached the party, who had been waiting quietly so as not to disturb the reunion of the siblings. Leona followed.

"sorry. You've been rude in front of your precious guests."

“No, that’s fine.”

Zich took a step forward and received the prince's words.

“First, let me introduce myself. It's called Dronian Pearl Soo Droud. He is the prince of `The Lake Clan` and that immature older brother."

To Dronian's introduction, Zich's group also introduced themselves.

“I have already heard the news. He said that he protected his brother and helped bring back 'Tears of the Lake'. I don't know how to repay this favor." He seemed really grateful. But he soon spoke in perplexity.

“If it were any other time, I would treat you with great hospitality, but the situation here is not so good right now.”

"I heard. A place called the ‘Iron Clan’ is holding hostages.”

"That's right."

Dronian replied grimly.

“I was looking for 'Tears of the Lake,' but what if I couldn't?”

Zich had already reacted negatively, but Leona asked, just in case. However, the answer returned from Dronian was also negative.

"Can not be done. To the last, these guys are just grabbing a house. Even if we brought back the 'Tear of the Lake', we can't release it."

“Are the only ones who have taken hostages by the 'Lake Clan', the King's wife and wife, and the shaman?”

Everyone's attention was focused on Zich, who suddenly asked.

Attending 'Ipuola' would be the same for other elves. What happened to those people? At least

I think it is whether they agree with the 'Iron Clan', or whether they are also imprisoned by the king.”

“Well, may I ask why you are curious about that?”

Dronian asked.

It was because Zich felt reluctant to ask in too much detail.

In fact, they are in a state where war is about to break out right now.

No matter how much he was a benefactor who protected his brother and his clan's treasures, he couldn't help but feel doubtful about asking the situation like this.

So, Zich understood the Dronian's vigilance.

“It doesn’t matter. I thought we might be able to help.”

“Help?”

“Aren’t you in need of a mercenary?”

(Continued on next page)

No. 191 screen

"mercenary?"

“Yes, mercenary. If war broke out, wouldn't it be better to have more power?"

“O uh '
--T that •

Dronian swallowed a soft moan. To be honest, as Zich said, the more power you have right now, the better. But even then, he couldn't catch Zich's offer.

“You are worried. Perhaps for two reasons.”

Zich spread out two fingers.

“One is that we don’t know what our skills are.”

Zich folded one finger.

“And another question is whether it is right to have humans intervene in the war between the elves.”

Dronian was internally surprised. Zich had exactly what he was thinking.

"•••Yes."

There is nothing to gain by lying here. Dronian meekly admitted.

“If you are a mercenary, you must have your own skills. I don't know your skills. And I’m definitely reluctant to let humans get involved in this fight.”

“•••You are not in a hurry.”

"Yes?"

Dronian was perplexed by Zich's absurd remarks.

“Even if the war has not started, the relative strength is somewhat predictable.”

Of course, the information could be wrong, but thinking that way leaves you with no choice.

“If all the other clans were attached to the 'Iron Clan', the prince would never have been able to refuse my offer on the grounds that 'Humans are interfering in this war'. I would have said that we would see his skills right away.”

Rather, if even ants crawling on the floor could be used as power, they would have tried to send them out to the battlefield.

“That doesn’t mean that at least all of the other clans belonged to the ‘iron clan’. That doesn't mean that all the other clans are on the side of the 'lake clan'. If you had such a power advantage, you would have rejected my offer. We already have the upper hand, so we won't need to add an unreliable force.” Dronian listened to Zich quietly.

“There are two things I can guess. The clan attached to the 'lake clan' and the clan attached to the 'iron clan' are similar, or the other clan has not yet made a decision. I think there is a high possibility that the heads of other clans are also being captured.”

"Yes."

“Then the reluctance to hire human beings is probably because of the other clan’s point of view.”

“That’s right too.”

“But what if it could be more of an advantage?”

Dronian tilted his head.

“What do you think could be more of an advantage?”

“That we are human.”

I didn't understand right away. However, Dronian is a prince of the Lake Clan who has received successor classes. Besides, I'm not a person who's ever been told that I have low abilities.

He noticed Zich's intentions and opened his eyes wide.

>Your judgment is fine.

Zich raised Dronian's evaluation to the next level.

“You are human. They are characters who cannot appear in the Elven Wars. Of course, the 'Iron Clan' doesn't understand you. Because you weren't our strength in the first place. Just because you're attacking them doesn't mean you can't figure out what clan they are related to right away. In other words, it can be used like an unrelated third force.” Dronian looked at Zich.

“Am I right?”

"That's right. Of course, they will also suspect that some other clan may have hired humans. But we also cannot abandon the idea of being a third force.”

“If there is a clan that normally interacts deeply with humans, they will be the first to be suspicious, but as far as I know, there is no such clan.”

Just to the extent of doing business with some humans. And it was the same for `The Lake Clan`, and after the 'Tears of the Lake' robbery incident, the commercial activity was very poor.

“In the first place, aren’t we the power that even the prince expected? There is no need to fight within the camp of the 'Lake Clan'. As a third human force whose purpose is difficult to guess, it is enough to shake up the opponent.”

“It’s definitely tempting.”

I immediately thought of a few places to use.

“Your opinion is good. But before that, you know there's something to check, right?"

“It’s a skill.”

Zich chuckled.

In the first place, whether standing on the front line like `The Lake Clan` or acting alone with the party as Zich's opinion is based on the assumption that they have the skills. Without the skills, there is no place for them anywhere.

“Can you prove it?”

“Anyway.”

Zich looked back at the group.

“Whoever it is, the prince will be pleased.”

“Then I will prepare to see your skills. Until then, please rest for a while.”

Dronian entrusted an elf who was waiting by the side to guide Zich's party.

“Where are you going? You should talk to this brother.”

“Ugh!”

Leona, who was trying to escape after Zich's party, was caught by Dronean. She looked at Zich and the others with a look of hope for help, but there was no one who could stop the conversation between the siblings and the brother's admonition to the runaway brother.

In the end, Zich and his party left the room with Leona's dim eyes behind.

For a moment there was silence in the room. Dronian, who looked at Leona severely, and Leona, who lowered his head and looked at him.

“••• Whoo!”

A loud sigh escaped Dronian's mouth. Leona flinched and shrugged.

“Are you reflecting?”

"•••Huh."

“Can I trust that this will never happen again?”

“ O  ”
huh •

sigh once more. Dronian shook his head once and said.

“In my opinion, I want to spend a hundred years in a secluded place and reflect on myself, but I have come to 'Tears of the Lake' and the situation is the same, so please forgive me for this time.”

Leona shook her head. However, seeing the Dronian who had not yet erased his severe expression, he bowed his head again.

“If this happens just one more time, I will never let it go. Do you understand?”

“ o  ” O •

"great. Then let’s get this done.”

forgiven Leona felt something lightening her shoulders. However, Dronian's next words crushed her heart, which had become lighter, again.

“However, it doesn’t stop Fried’s nagging.”

"uh?"

Leona blinked her big eyes in embarrassment. Seeing that, Dronian grinned.

“Well, it would be more effective for you to have Fried nagging for hours than to be imprisoned somewhere for a hundred years.”

“Hey there, brother. A word to Fried as he forgave me... .”

She hurriedly asked Dronian for help. Of course, there was no choice.

“I won’t say a word to Fried, so don’t expect anything strange. And when my father, mother, and grandmother return, I am prepared to hear a word from them as well.”

Leona, who was crying and wondering how to withstand Freed's nagging, stopped moving.

“•••Are you really incarcerated? father and mother? And even grandma?”

"•••okay."

A bitterness crept over De Ronian's face, who had maintained a dignified attitude as a prince and Leona's older brother.

In the absence of his father and the king of his clan, he did not show any sympathy to others to fill the vacant position, but his pain inevitably leaked out in front of his family.

“But don't worry too much. They want our obedience, so they won't hurt them easily. If we do harm to them, instead of obeying, we will fight them to the death and death.”

But it was dangerous. There are three important hostages held, so as an example, one could be killed, and in the worst case, all three could be killed.

But he couldn't express his worries to his younger brother.

“They will come back safely. So I have an excuse for them.”

"•••Huh."

As if to disturb the gloomy atmosphere, Dronian raised his voice slightly and asked Leona.

“But your colleagues. I'm grateful that you fight as our mercenaries, but I don't know what your skills are. Do you know?” Hearing that, Leona smirked. Very bold and confident.

“It’s not because I’m with my colleagues, it’s them.”

She answered vigorously.

“It’s insanely strong!”

* * *

The place prepared to show his skills was behind the royal palace. The place where the royal guards were trained was a place where the trees were densely packed, so they could avoid the eyes of the other elves.

“I will check my skills through a duel. Are you okay?”

"Fine."

Zich, who came out first, swung Windur carelessly as if he was unwinding. An elf walked out in front of him.

“Are you your opponent?”

"That's right."

The opponent was Deniel, whom I had broken up with earlier. He was holding a sharp sword.

It was a slender sword compared to Windur, which had a certain size and bulk, but the strength of the swords was not that important, since he was an elf who used magic much more skillfully than humans.

Of course, Windur's strength was so strong that it could not even be compared with other ordinary swords.

“He is a former royal guard, so he has considerable skill among our clan. And if you are hired by us, you will have to hide your relationship with us as much as possible, so I decided that it would be better to deal with Deniel, whom you know better than to let others know about you.”

>You're a good judge, too.

He was truly a wonderful prince.

“That's a good idea. We also wore robes to hide our identities while we were coming to the capital after meeting Denis L, so it will be even more difficult to reveal our identities.”

“Did you?”

Dronian looked at Deniel. Deniel, who had guided Zich and his party up to this place, nodded.

“You made a wise decision.”

Dronian looked at Zich's face again.

>The fact that they grasped our situation earlier, that they proposed to use their position as human beings, that they hid their identities, and that they are very quick to judge the situation.

He said that the man named Zich was the leader of the group. And a boss who can quickly judge the situation is good, not a disadvantage.

>If it's a detached unit led by a person with such a judgment, it's worth looking forward to.

Dronian prayed for Zich and his companions to have satisfactory skills, so that they could be a strong hand in this difficult situation.

However, Dronian's thoughts were shattered as soon as the battle began.

Of course in a much better way.

(Continued on next page)

No. 192 screen

Deniel was a fairly high-level swordsman. In the first place, a sword is not a weapon that elves like to use.

To them, who were good at hitting and falling through the forest with bows and arrows, no matter how good they were, the sword meant nothing more than a second-in-command. Of course, his sword skills have dropped considerably.

However, the royal escort that Deniel belonged to is different. As they were elves, they had excellent bow skills, and their swordsmanship skills were also at a high level.

And Deniel was the person who even escorted the princess Leona. Even in the Royal Guard, he was quick to count from the top.

>That Daniel... .

Dronian couldn't help but be surprised at the sight in front of him.

bang! bang!

The swords that have been strengthened with magical power clashed continuously, and there is a loud bang.

Zich swung his sword again. Windur struck Deniel's three swords.

Quang!

A roar rang once again. Daniel frowned and took a few steps back.

>What kind of power... !

Deniel glared at Zich and tightened his grip on the sword. If I didn't do that, I thought I'd miss the sword at any moment.

“Suck!”

Spurs the ground strongly and runs to Zich.

It has been confirmed that the force is being pushed. But Daniel was still confident.

As an elf with more natural magical power than humans and superior physical abilities, it hurts my pride that I was pushed by force, but I did not intend to continue pushing myself to build up my pride.

Moreover, he was a swordsman who focused on speed rather than strength as he used a three swords.

“Ha!”

His sword stabs quickly. It's a speed that a human without training can't even react.

But Zich struck his sword very lightly.

But Daniel was not disappointed. Rather, the current stab was only a bait.

Tat!

With flashy and quick footwork, he turns to the side of Zich.

>I can't respond... !

quaang

He managed to defend the Windur that flew towards him. Daniel was shocked. Zich's eyes were looking at him with arcs drawn.

Whoo! Whoo!

Windur continues to swing. Deniel struck Windur with his sword.

>It's heavy!

It's not just about power.

>Are you faster than me?

I did not think that humans were an inferior race.

However, due to their innate body, magical powers, and long lifespan, they thought that elves had no choice but to be stronger than humans.

So when I was told that Zich had asked me to hire them, I thought that the human trait could be a tactic advantage, but I couldn't expect much.

But after a few sword strikes, his thoughts were completely shattered.

take a deep breath Sweat trickled down my forehead and grazed my eyes. It was painful, but I couldn't close my eyes. If I blinked my eyes, I felt like I was going to miss my opponent right away.

>What do we do?

his head twitches His tenacity for victory only offered possibilities in all directions.

>••• Also give me an arm or a leg... .

Then a loud voice was heard.

"stop!"

For a moment, Deniel's vision, which had only seen Zich in front of him, widened. Other thoughts began to fill his head, which was only focused on defeating Zich.

>Oh, it was a duel.

It's not about risking your life for half with your own goals, it's about checking your skills.

Deniel shook his head a few times as if to blow away the heat of battle, and then extended his hand toward Zich.

“I was amazed. He was very strong.”

“So are you. It is rare for an elf who mainly uses a bow to use a sword like this.”

Zich took his hand and waved it lightly.

“How are the test results?”

The goal is not to win a duel. Zich asked Dronian.

"I'll have to look at the skills of other people first, but at least you seem to be able to play an active part in the battlefield enough."

Dronian's face, who confirmed Zich's skills, was quite bright. Then, Zich's other party looked at him as well.

Since Zich is so strong, he also expected the skills of others.

And his expectations were not met.

“Ha!”

Although Hans's ability to wield a large sword was not as good as that of Zich, it was enough to admire.

“Ugh!”

coo!

Snock's ability to manipulate the land was astonishing even for elves with considerable knowledge.

and.

Aww!

When he saw Lyla's no-changing magic and its power, Dronian clearly understood. He said he had a huge hand in hand.

“How are you?”

“Great! It's beyond imagination!”

Dronian was delighted to the point of breaking down the etiquette and solemnity he had been keeping until now.

“Then are you going to hire us?”

"of course."

There is no reason not to hire such power.

>It's a credit problem, but Leo is the one who saved me and brought back 'Tears of the Lake', so you can trust me to some extent.

Now, there was only one problem left to hire them.

“Then it’s up to you to set the hiring cost.”

What is important to a mercenary? it's money They are the ones who change their money, their skills, and their lives.

“How much do you want? Humans don’t have much money, so I’d like to pay with something like jewelry.” But Zich was not very interested in money. They were able to travel in luxury with just what they had now.

Of course, I have no intention of refusing to give. But Zich wanted something else.

“Do you know anything about the ancient empire?”

“Ancient Empire?”

"Yes. I heard from Leona that there was a mighty human empire long ago.”

Dronian stroked his chin.

“There are many empires that have been created and destroyed by humans, but it seems that they do not want an explanation of such an ordinary empire. If so, there is one thing that comes to mind. Even among us elves there is an empire of men that has been handed down as a legend.”

“Do you have any information about that empire?”

“Even if it were information, there would be only stories that came down from our mouths.”

“That’s fine too. Could you please put them all together?”

“It will not be difficult. Older people like to tell old stories. If you ask me to write down some legends you know, they will be happy to do so. Rather, you will like it because you have a pastime. Is that all you want?”

"That's right. If you think it is not enough, you can give the rest in moderation.”

But that doesn't mean you can't afford it. It was related to the face of the 'lake clan'.

>I'll give you a decent amount of jewelry, though.

At that moment, Dronian's head flashed.

“Then how about this? Mentis has a library of our elves. It's called Calfnal.”

“A library?”

"That's right. This is where the books that our ancestors began to collect one by one were kept. Although it is called a library, it is more like a tomb of books. It is said that the book was collected, but it was not built with the plan to build a library in the first place, it was just a collection of books brought by our ancestors. But the amount is huge. And it is no exaggeration to say that its history is almost the same as the history of Adrowon Great Forest.”

>Is there such a thing?

If so, then it is a salivating existence.

“There are a few problems, one is that although it is maintained to a certain extent, the collection is so large and there are many old books that the condition of the books is not going to be very good.”

“That  is acceptable.”

At first, I was planning to collect only the legends handed down to the elves, but there was no problem because I had an opportunity to get certain information.

“And one more. As history is history, it is not only our 'lake clan', but also the treasure of the entire Adrowon Great Forest clan. Therefore, permission from the other clan must also be obtained.”

That was a bit tricky. No matter how strong the 'lake clan' claims, there will certainly be some clan that are reluctant to show their heritage to humans.

But Zich smiled rather.

“I have to say this, but the timing is good.”

“Yes, the timing is good.”

Although it was bittersweet, Dronian also agreed with Zich's words.

“There is no situation in which we can give grace to all the elves as we are now.”

The situation in which the kings of the entire clan were taken hostage. However, if Zich then helps rescue the kings, at least no clan will object to accessing the library.

“You have one more reason to be active in this war. Oh, of course, you don't need permission from the 'Iron Clan', right?"

"of course."

At Zich's joke, Dronian showed a cold and sharp smile.

“They will not have a voice in this great forest for at least hundreds of years. Of course, on the premise that they survive.”

After that, after talking with Dronian for a while, Zich and his party went into the room they were assigned to.

Leona, who was secretly trying to follow Zich and the others, was caught by Fried and dragged away. The group ignored her pleading for help with tears in her eyes.

When Zich arrived at the room, he looked at the party and said refreshingly.

“That’s why I joined the elven war.”

“What is it?”

Lyla protested the decision that the group's opinions were not reflected at all.

But there was no power in her voice. I've already given up halfway through it. That's why he showed off his skills in the duel.

"what. Are you unwilling to help Leona? I usually take care of Leona like that. He's a little bit cruel."

When Lyla raised her double wick, Zich took a few steps back.

But it was only for a short time that they joked like that.

“Like I just said with the prince, I will participate in this war. What are you going to do? Are you going to fall?”

The battlefield was the place where magic blossomed in its splendor, but Zich had no intention of forcing it on her.

“If you fall, do you have any desire to help Leona again?”

“Because there is a difference between respecting opinions and telling the truth.” She snorted at Zich's shameless answer.

"done. After all, I'm in favor of helping Leona. And I'm interested in what you're going to get."

Lyla looked at Hans and Snock.

“What are you going to do?”

“Ah, we… .”

“What are you asking?”

Zich interrupted Hans who was about to answer.

“They must follow me. You were the only one I asked for opinions, Laila.”

Hans smiled bitterly and nodded as if he knew Snock would.

“You go in first. You will have a hard time in the future, so please rest.”

Hans and Snock went out to find their assigned room. Lyla tried to follow them, but Zich caught him.

"Why?"

“Is this elf civil war in your memory?

there is?"

Even Zich had no detailed knowledge of the elven civil war.

“I don’t really remember.”

“Is that so?”

“But I think it had something to do with Glen Gennard. I feel that way.”

(Continued on next page)

No. 193 screen

Zich's eyes lit up.

“By the way, did you say you saw the future when I was a hero?”

“ O  ”
huh.

“Then, do you have any other thoughts about Glen Gennard’s future?”

"Well… .”

For a moment, Lyla searched through the hole in her knowledge.

“… No, there is not. I don't know if it's in my lost memory, but at least not in the memory I have now."

“What kind of guy was Glen Zenard when I was a warrior?”

“A time when you were a hero?”

Hearing that, Lyla was also curious. But that didn't come to mind either.

“I’m interested, but I still can’t remember.”

"OK got it."

After patting her on the shoulder with an apologetic expression, Zich sent her to her own room too.

>Even though Lyla lost her memory, she doesn't remember any other futures of Glen Zenard.

Zich himself is a hero, and Laila, who has seen a future that is completely different from that of the Demon King, says that he cannot see any other future for Glen Zenard.

Of course, it could be a coincidence or it could be that Lyla doesn't remember.

>But I'm sure it's suspicious.

Zich's suspicions about Glen deepened.

Officially hired by the 'Clan of the Lake', Zich's party moved right away.

It's not a good thing to procrastinate. Leona wanted to follow, but Dronian was against it, and Zich refused.

“ I can’t take the elves with me because it has to be seen as the third power, the power of humans.”

For obvious reasons, Leona couldn't even use a swarm. With a sad face, he sent off Zich and the others.

Daniel didn't show me the path to 'Mentis'. He also planned to return after guiding exactly to the 'mentis'.

They crossed over the lush forest and arrived at their destination.

“That’s ‘Mentis’.”

Those who saw where Deniel was pointing exclaimed.

There was a big lake. No, it was awkward to call it a lake.

Beyond the lake shore was the long horizon, not the other side of the lake. If Daniel hadn't told him it was a lake, everyone would have thought it was an ocean.

In the middle of that great lake was a huge island. The island, which appeared through the light fog, looked very mysterious and majestic.

“As you can see, it's blocked off by lakes on all sides, which gives us a strong defensive advantage. There is only one passageway over there.”

The lake shore and Mentis were connected by a single bridge.

As seen in the capital of the 'Lake Clan', it was made of living trees intertwined.

Although it was quite large for a bridge, it was still not enough to make up for the shortcomings of limited access.

Zich gave his eyes strength and looked at the mentis.

“It’s very different from the elves’ cities I’ve seen so far.”

Unlike the city of the 'Lake Clan' made of wood, most of the buildings standing in Mentis were made of stone. There were trees, but compared to other elven cities, there were none.

>It's more like a human city.

“Because of that, there are no elves living in that city. There are only a few people who manage it. It is inconvenient for us.”

Daniel put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a scroll of paper.

“This is the map of the 'mentis' that you asked me to give you.”

Zich took it and unfolded it. The internal structure of the large island and its description were written there. And there were several places circled in red.

“The circled area is probably the point where the hostages are expected to be held.”

“If there is an opportunity, I will look into it.”

Zich put the map in the magic box.

Daniel continued to explain.

“It’s hard to see because the forest is all around, but this is where everyone’s eyes are now. Like our clan, other clan must have hidden a group of troops. Scouts are basic.”

Even with Zich's senses, quite a number of human enemies were being captured. They will all be elves.

“Then I will go. I wish you all the best of luck.”

Daniel disappeared into the forest in an instant. It was also an elf-like movement called a forest dweller.

“What are you going to do now?”

Lyla asks. Zich looked at the Mentis in the distance.

“First, we have to make a mark that humans have intervened in this war.”

Then, Jik chuckled.

“Let’s exercise a little harder this evening.”


The sun went down and the moon came up. The lake reflects the twinkling stars in the sky and shines splendidly.

But that's it. Darkness certainly covered the rest.

But there was only one place, where the darkness was artificially driven out.

It was 'mentis'.

A great number of torches were burning in 'Mentis' as if trying to reproduce the daytime throughout the city.

Armed forces come and go between the cities. There were a lot of troops patrolling as if they were going to make it without a single blind spot.

A black seal passed through them.

Two guard elves walked to a slightly secluded place in 'Mentis'.

No matter how many troops are turned to patrol, there are places where there is no choice but to create a blind spot for a while due to the size of the island.

What was unfortunate for the two elves was that they were heading to such a place.

A shadow approached behind them.

Whoo!

“Uh-huh!”

“Kek!”

With a single sword, both elves had their necks cut in half. The elves' bodies fell. Their bodies were wriggling as they hadn't died yet, but that was soon after.

The airway is cut off and cannot make a sound. It didn't take long for their bodies to droop.

The man who killed the two elves, Zich, crept again. He slaughtered the moving elves to continue reconnaissance while hiding their presence.

how much is that The elves around them disappeared. Zich stood in the middle of what had become a deserted area and put Windur over his shoulders.

>You'll notice it soon enough.

No matter how secretly they were removed, too many guards were killed. As evidence, a commotion was heard in the distance. There was also the sound of urgent footsteps.

>Then shall we start?

Whik!

Zich whistled.

Hearing the whistling sound of the running elves, he could feel the elves turning in the direction of Zich. But Jik didn't run away.

It wasn't long before a group of armed elves came running.

“There!”

The elf, who seemed to be the commander, pointed to Zich. The soldier elves directly aimed their bows at Zich. The commander was surprised when he saw Zich's true identity.

"•••human?"

The elves behind him were also confused by his remarks.

" human?"

“Why are humans here… !”

"quiet!"

The commander calmed down the bewildered subordinates. Then I slowly looked around with Zich.

I saw the face of my fellow countrymen who were dying. There was blood on his face.

“•••Is that your thing?”

“Oh, this?”

Zich tapped the elf's corpse under his feet.

“I thought it would make a lot of noise if caught.”

Saying so, he chuckled.

“Oh, wasn’t he the one who shouldn’t be killed? Maybe your brother or something? If that's the case, I apologize. Sorry."

Then I took a coin from my pocket and flipped it in front of my commander. It was the most valuable coin in the human world.

“Can you forgive me for this? I don't have money. But anyway, your younger brother, you're a piece of garbage that you'll live by eating your back and forth from now on, right? Thinking about it, shouldn't I be paid for taking care of it?"

Zich had a truly sincere, completely unjust expression on his face.

The commander's face went red. The expressions of the elves behind them also hardened.

Zich tilted his head and tapped the body again.

"Huh? Wasn't this guy your brother? Unbelievable! You mean that stupid, incompetent, unlucky bastard that devours your spine is still alive? sorry. definitely this is my mistake So don't stare like that and tell me where your brother is... .”

“Catch it!”

The commander shouted with a shattered throat. The soldiers also sharpened their teeth and fired arrows at Zich. However, Zich swung Windur and struck out all the arrows.

visor! visor! visor!

Some soldiers took out their swords. And ran towards Zich. The rest of the soldiers continued to fire arrows.

The elf was really good at shooting arrows while avoiding the allies in front of him as if he were an elf.

But this time, Zich easily hit the arrow and whistled once more.

Chunkyung! Chunkyung! Chunkyung! Suddenly, a sound of iron was heard around, and people in heavy armor started pouring out from both sides.

"uh? huh?”

The commander was perplexed. The soldiers also stopped trying to attack Zeeg and looked at the armor.

Zich exclaimed loudly.

“Ha ha! It's war, you guys! It is the sacred and sacred land of the noble elves! There will be a plethora of valuable items, so pack them all!”

“Wow!”

The armor roared and stormed the elves.

“What are these children!”

“Where did you come from!”

“Don’t panic!”

The commander shouted loudly.

“Get in line and hold on! Reinforcements are coming soon... !”

"No."

Suddenly, the commander felt goosebumps all over his body when he heard a noise from the side.

He tried to swing the sword in a hurry, but before that, the sword came out of his chest first.

“Big billion!”

The commander looked at the one who stabbed him with trembling eyes. A man who despised himself was approaching.

“In war, the commander is killed first. Common sense.”

👌👌👌👌👌

Zich drew his sword. The commander collapsed helplessly.

What he saw before he collapsed was that all his men in front of him were lying on their backs drenched in blood, and the other men were brutally slaughtered by the armor.


There was an uproar in 'Mentis'. A group of troops that appeared suddenly began to sweep the island.

The response of the 'Iron Clan' was delayed. Most of the main force to prevent intrusion was focused on the bridge.

The guards patrolling the island were meant to respond in case a small number of units came in through the lake to rescue the hostages.

However, no one expected that a large-scale military force would appear from the rear.

“What fuss is this!”

The king of the 'Iron Clan', 'Renuent de Las' asked his subordinates.

“An intruder has appeared on the back of the island!”

“You mean this riot was caused by just a small number of troops!”

It was embarrassing to be pushed back like this, no matter how infiltrating the elite troops. But his subordinate denied his words.

“Not a few! The number of enemies is quite large!”

“A lot! How did such an army get into the rear! What was the guard doing! I told you to be so wary of infiltration by boat!”

“I checked, but the ship never came!”

“Then how did they break in!”

The subordinate bows his head. Renu stood up for a while, then spoke again.

“What kind of clan did you say!”

“Not a clan!” Renu couldn't help but panic at the next words of his subordinate.

“Your opponent is human!”

No. 194 screen

The confusion of 'mentis' continued. Zich took the lead and slaughtered the elves, followed by armor.

Armor wasn't just for fighting. They rushed into the nearby houses at random. But the houses were empty, with only a few stalks.

<<Leader! There is nothing in the house!>>

One of the armored men said to Zich. Zich made an impression.

"No way! You said that this is the holy place of the elves! If you look for it, there is no such thing as a treasure!”

<<But not really!>>

Scratch!

Zich cut off the leg of one of the elves who attacked him. The elf fell down with a loud scream.

“Sheesh! After all, I have to shake off the places where it seems to be.”

What Zich looked at was a large building in the middle of the island. It was made of stacked white stones, and it was like the castle where the kings in the fairy tales I saw as a child lived.

Zich kicked the elf screaming and squawking at his feet and pushed it to the side of the car. Then he roughly slashed the flying arrow and aimed Windur towards the castle in the center.

“Attack that castle! Everyone who is looking for the house, get out!”

And he took the lead and advanced while slashing the elves.

However, no matter how much Zich took the lead and slashed the elves, there was a limit even if the men were armed with solid armor. There is a difference in numbers.

As the elves of 'Mentis' started to join in earnest, the progress gradually slowed down.

<<Leader! Too many enemies!>>

"I know!"

Zich responded by punching the elf who was rushing at him. The elf's body flew like a piece of paper and crashed into the building next door.

“Damn it! It's said that there are usually only a few administrative elves here! Why are there so many gossips!”

<<I think the information is probably wrong

I did!>>

“I can’t help it.”

Zich gave a lot of strength to his neck. And he shouted out loud using his magical power.

"retreat!"

The movement of the armor that was attacking stopped suddenly. And then, slowly, he began to back away.

“Where are you going to retreat, you bastards!”

An elf who was nearby screamed and ran towards him.

bang!

His sword was blocked by Windur. Windur's branch-like blade-god entangled the elf's sword. Zich broke his wrist and twisted Windur.

visor!

With a clear sound, the elf's sword was cut in two.

“It’s my heart.”

puck!

The sword broke in Zich's Windur and slashed the face of the bewildered elf. The elves were thrown around, sprinkled with blood and teeth.

"retreat! Retreat, you bastards!”

Zich took a step back and kept calling back. The armor in the back goes out all at once, and the armor in the front slowly retreats.

The elves lit their eyes on the corpses of their people around them and ran towards them. There was a clear feeling that they would not let even one person live.

But soon after, the sound from behind had no choice but to soften the momentum.

"stop! stop! Don't rush after them!"

There was no way the bright-eared elves could not hear the sound mixed with magical power. Besides, the owner of this voice is their general. I feel like I want to chase them down and behead them right away, but orders are orders.

While grinding their teeth, the elves gradually lowered the speed of their pursuit. Taking advantage of that opportunity, Zich and the armor kept their distance from the elves.

“The whole army has slowed down!”

"great!"

The general of the 'Iron Clan', 'Kendis Lau Elivi', who came out in a hurry, clenched his fists.

“Keep a certain distance. Keep your distance, but keep pushing! After all, the only place they escaped is the lake!” Halfway through, the commanders who had lined up announced his orders to the soldiers.

Kendis sharpened her teeth.

“I don’t know how they got in, but if you think that you can go out without a hitch like this, you are mistaken!”

“But I don't know how they got in! You can even use that method to escape when retreating!”

“So, you have to keep a certain distance. Whether they're on a boat or diving, you just have to launch an attack at that moment. After all, this is where we saw it.”

When any army is most vulnerable it is when it retreats.

“Keep shooting arrows! Damage them!”

Clouds of invisible arrows rose and fell all at once into the dark sky of 'Mentis'. But is it because of the thick armor? The enemies that took damage from the arrow seemed to be few.

>Are you wearing any kind of mithril armor!

Elven bows and arrows are different from human ones. Besides, it has a lot of magical power, so it can easily pierce through steel plates.

However, to their surprise, their arrows did not penetrate the armor and bounced off.

Some fell, but the other armor quickly supported it and retreated.

Kendis frowned.

>Do you have that kind of leeway while retreating?

It is a heavy, heavy armor by anyone looking at it. But they retrieved the armor without any hesitation.

>Shall we do a close fight?' But he shook his head. The 'iron clan' might have to go to war with the other all elf clan if it's too late.

Even now, beyond the bridge of Mentis, there must be forces hidden by other clans.

Because of that, the troops near the bridge could not even move. Maybe they hear this commotion and come attacking.

>I can't even ask for support from my home country.' Armies of other clans may also be stationed on the borders of their home countries. Literally, they ran too far.

Thanks to the kings of each country who have been taken hostage, the tense situation that is being kept close is now.

>I have to conserve my troops somehow now. No more reinforcements!

Fortunately, many arrows have been prepared. Even if you consume a little too much now, there will be no problem.

“Keep shooting!”

In the end, Kendis tried to consume the opposing forces from a distance as before. Although the opponent's armor was strong, there were definitely some who fell.

Soon they were able to push Zich's party to the shores of the lake.

The enemies have nowhere else to go. pushed Kendis thought so.

"Huh?"

But he soon became puzzled.

>The number of those guys... .

At first glance, it looked very small. he looked back Look at the road you've passed

>does not exist!

If the number of enemies has decreased, it should be visible whether they are dead or wounded. But all he could see was a road that had been trampled on by a large number of troops.

>Did you run away in the meantime? Maybe it's not a ship or an underwater infiltration?

His senses signaled a crisis.

“All troops onslaught! Trample them!”

Kendis gave the order hastily.

>Now is not the time to worry about consuming troops! If you don't know the penetration route of these guys, there will be a hole in the boundary!

At least a prisoner of war should be captured and questioned.

As if the elves were waiting, they rushed in. It is true that they grinded their teeth to those who broke in at night and slaughtered their own people.

But the armor did not deal with them. They turned their backs and ran to the back of a nearby building.

“Go into siege!”

The elves split in two, one chasing the enemy and the other rounding the building. It was necessary to block the way ahead.

But their intentions failed.

"uh?"

"what?"

The elves who went into siege to the enemy met each other.

But they couldn't help but make stupid voices.

All they could see was the same people, but there was no enemy they were pursuing.

I looked up and down as well as front and back, left and right, and scanned the ground with my feet, but nothing was found. They looked at each other desperately.

Kendis heard the report too.

“What nonsense are you talking about!”

He pushes the lieutenant with a red face. However, urging the lieutenant does not mean that the disappearing enemy appears.

Kendis gave the order.

“Search now! Find where they disappeared! If you find even a single piece of armor, report it to me!”

The soldiers are scattered in all directions. Holding a torch, he looked from the street to the shaded alleys, the wavy shoreline, and even the water, digging into the ground, and looking at the sky.

But there were no signs of enemies. complete sleep.

In a situation where so many troops had completely disappeared, Kendis was absurd.

“How could this...”

What the hell am I supposed to report to the king? Kendis felt his mind wandering.

♦ * *

Zich opened his eyes. I brushed my whole body. The soil fell a little. He shaved his head and walked through the passageway in front of him.

"Come on."

Lyla greeted him.

“Snow?”

"excuse me."

Lyla pointed to one side. Snock looked a little tired and bowed his head to Zich.

“Are you here?”

“Yeah, well done. You did really well this time.”

Snock laughed even though he was tired.

The biggest contributor to this operation was Snock. Without him, it would have been impossible to 'disguise' a large army.

Zich patted him on the shoulder once and looked at Lyla again.

“How many are damaged?”

“Pretty much.”

Lyla pointed the other way this time.

There, there were piles of armor that had fought fiercely with the elves until recently.

It was as if the bodies of dead knights were gathered in one place.

But even though the 'Iron Clan', who had worked with those armors so far, was outraged, they were just empty armors.

“I would say it is an elf arrow. Even though we strengthened the metal quite a bit, it pierced through a direct hit.”

Snock shook his head.

Zich looked at the nearest armor. The hole punched in by the elf's arrow and the flowing blood stains were clear.

But it didn't matter. Only that much, Zich did not intend to disparage Snock's work.

“No, that is enough. In the first place, I never thought that I would block all their attacks.”

The opponent is an elite soldier of the elf. No matter how thick the armor was, it was greed to expect that it would completely block it, unless it was a great metal like a mithril.

“The play of getting injured was also perfect.”

The armor that moved along with Zich, like a human army.

They were all 'empty armor' that Snok moved.

The source of the idea was, of course, Midas.

The armor he used when he attacked Zich and his group, which moved by plating the main joints.

As soon as Zich learned how to use it, he started training Snock the same way.

The conditions were better for Snook. Midas only had control over gold, but Snok had control over all minerals.

Instead of plating the joints like Midas, the armor itself can be moved.

Of course, the training was difficult as it was Zich's training. Zich was not satisfied with moving a few planes.

If Snock wanted to get used to the given armor adjustment, he increased the number of moving armor.

Fortunately, there was a lot of armor that Midas had collected, so it wasn't difficult to get the armor.

>He must have kept it for later as well.

What was created was a large army that followed Zich.

Of course, no matter how Snok was, it was impossible to control all that much armor. So I borrowed Lyla's hand.

(Continued on next page)


No. 195 Tuesday

It's true that Snock controlled a lot of armor, but that doesn't mean he controlled a lot of it alone. He didn't have that kind of ability yet.

Snock's controls were nothing more than those that fought directly in the front. The rest were golems made by Lyla.

Even if they were golems, they were different from the mithril golems they faced.


At best, these guys just run around as ordered, and shouldn't even expect a proper battle.

Of course, that's not to say that Lyla's skills are bad.

No, no matter how much jewels and mithril she had, she wore the armor she had on her body, but the fact that she mass-produced golems capable of reproducing human movements for more than a certain amount in such a short period of time is rather impressive. was showing

“No matter how urgent it is, the efficiency is low and the power is poor.


Making a flag golem... .”

Of course, it seemed that he did not like his work very much.

But there was no need for more golems. Now, Zich's party didn't have to have great power. It was enough to just mistake them for people with a lot of brains.

Above all, it was obvious that there would not be enough time to make a golem that Lyla was satisfied with. very much too.

>I mean, I think I'll break it because I don't like even a golem that can be used well enough.

Like some kind of craftsman.

Of course, this did not mean that the plan was neglected. A small pouch filled with animal blood was placed in the armor, and blood flowed when the arrow was hit.

All that was left was to put them in the magic box and then take them out after infiltrating them.

The same goes for retreating. In the midst of the turmoil of the battlefield, Sieg kept his armor in a magic box from time to time.

And after hiding behind the building completely blocking the view of the enemies, the rest of the armor was also stored.

All that was left was to get rid of his body, and it was very easy.

“You stop sleeping. We will have to keep doing this in the future.”

"all right."

Still, I was a little tired. Snock cautiously grabbed Knowwet, dozing off his shoulder, and headed to his room.

Zich also brought Hans into the room.

Hans also wore armor and had been helping Zich all this time.

No matter how elaborately Snok moves his armor, Lyla's golems take care of the details, but it was convenient for the plan to have at least one talented person who moves with independent judgment.

In addition, it had to play a role in raising the mood by talking to Zich (?).

When Hans and Snock were gone, Zich told Laila.

"I found it?"

"here. I marked it.”

Lyla handed him a roll of paper. Zich handed it over and opened it up.

It was the map Dronian gave him. A new mark was added to the place marked with a high probability of being held hostage. It was a new drawing by Lyla.

While Zich was running rampant in 'Mentis', Lyla quietly looked over the city from the sky. And the movement of the troops was grasped in detail and recorded on the map.

It was to figure out exactly where the hostage was.

“First of all, I don’t think this place and this place are. There were too few troops coming out.” He touched each of the two places where Lyla was marked with his hands. It was already marked with an X.

“It’s the same here and here. Rather, there are too many troops coming out here. It must be the main residence of the soldiers.”

“Where in doubt?”

"here."

Lyla tapped one spot.

“No troops came out from here alone.”

“Isn’t it empty?”

“There was light. I've seen a few people come out of the building to figure out what's going on. But no one took part in the battle. Rather, we went around the building and strengthened our defenses. So what do you mean?”

“The building has something important to protect.”

Zich laughed out loud.

“Isn’t it the enemy’s command center or something like that?”

“It is a small two- story building. It's not a building that 'high people' would prefer. Actually, the head of the 'Iron Clan' seems to be in the 'Castle' I saw earlier. If you look at the movements of the troops around the castle, yes.”

“I would usually stay there.”

“What are you going to do now?”

There was something long-winded in Laila's voice as she asked. As if examining Zich's reaction, her eyes glared at him.

“We should search that place first. I've found a place with a high probability, but I don't know if there are really hostages there."

At Zich's answer, she calmed down a little.

>Fortunately, there seems to be no intention of prolonging the war or anything like that.

If it was 'Demon King Zich Moore', he would have tried to somehow increase the duration of his rampage. At least, Zich didn't look like a demon king yet.

>If possible, I would like this state to continue... .

Whether he was aware of Lyla's concerns or not, Zich pinched a part of the map with his finger.

“Next time, we have to attack from this side.”

“Aren’t you going right where the hostages are?”

“The cooperation between us and the ‘Lake Clan’ may be exposed. We have to be the ones who came to steal the treasures of the elves who might not know where they might go.”

Zich said with a smile.

“You have to go as vulgar and ignorant as the thieves.”

“Are you going to pretend you’re aiming somewhere else?”

“It is also the biggest and most gorgeous place.”

“Then there is only one.”

Zich and Lyla's eyes focused on one place. It was the highest castle on the island, where the dignitaries of the 'Iron Clan' were most likely to be there.

“Then, shall we go to sleep for tomorrow too?”

Zich looked up at the ceiling.

"It won't be as comfortable as a real home, but it's good enough in the basement."

Surprisingly, the place they were in was a fairly large underground space created deep underground in 'Mentis'.

It was a place that Snock, who infiltrated last night, diligently dug without being detected by the 'Iron Clan'.

The walls, floor, and ceiling were all made of soil, but since it was processed with great care by Snok, who deals with the power of the earth, its strength was strong.

Even a large earthquake will not collapse. The depth was considerable, so there was no danger of being caught by the elves above.

>The air is damp, but you have to bear that much.

Although the ventilation holes are drilled, the depth is deep, so there is no choice but to lack of air circulation.

However, because of Zich, Zich and his group have been trained through all kinds of homelessness. Soon, everyone in the party fell asleep one by one. The 'iron clan' was puzzled by the army of humans who suddenly appeared and disappeared suddenly.

Of course, the boundaries were further strengthened. The lights were brighter and the guards increased.

In particular, as Kendis, who would normally have gone to bed, was walking around the island with his eyes wide open, the guards had no choice but to be alert.

>These motherfuckers!

Just thinking about yesterday, Kendis couldn't stand it because of his temper.

As a general of the 'iron clan', he was proud of taking on an important role in the plan for the clan's infinite revival.

If this plan succeeds, the 'iron clan' will become the true and true masters of this great forest, and perhaps even the human world may not be able to expand its power.

And as the vanguard of the plan, he would become a general who would enjoy the West and honor and be revered from generation to generation.

Therefore, he wanted to finish this role without a single gap. And it worked, at least until yesterday.

The other clan could not easily attack because of the hostage, and intermittently captured and killed the scouts who hid. Things went so smoothly that the steam leaked.

But it all changed last night.

A group of presumed humans. They suddenly appeared and stirred the 'mentis' he guarded. In the meantime, a significant number of fellow countrymen died.

For those who had to conserve power somehow, it was quite a big deal.

With that alone, they succeeded in escaping the 'mentis' without leaving a single corpse on the plate with their teeth grinding.

I don't know how to get out.

“Damn it!”

Unbeknownst to me, swear words came out of my mouth.

The soldiers, who had noticed the bad boss, fell a little further to Kendis. It was obvious that he was going to suffer an embarrassment for touching his heart for nothing.

Kendis wasn't a very good-natured boss.

>How the hell did you get out!

He continued to ponder, not caring at all how the soldiers looked at him.

How many swear words and insults he suffered from his monarch because of what happened at that time. But he couldn't even respond properly.

Therefore, he prayed that the humans would reappear.

>I'll hold you perfectly this time!

He was going to chew it very well without missing a single one.

It was then.

“Enemy!”

A shout was heard from afar.

“These guys from yesterday! They are all attacking again!”

Kendis's bloodshot eyes flashed.

* * *

“Catch it!”

“Never miss today!”

The elves are screaming and heading somewhere. The sight of them running around with torches and weapons was lifelike.

However, if you pay attention to one, you tend to pay less attention to the other.

A terrifying number of torches pierced through the darkness and concentrated in one place, while on the other side, a silent darkness expanded its power.

And there was a quiet movement through the darkness.

fault!

Zich seeped into a dimly lit building. He pressed the robes he was wearing deep down and quietly felt his presence.

>There aren't many elves around.

Zich went up to the roof of the building. You can see where the bright light gathers. It was a place where the elves and armor fought.

Today, Zich was going to infiltrate the place that Lyla pointed out as a suspicious place and find out if there were any hostages. It was Hans who was now leading the armor.

He looked in the direction once and turned his head.

>I'll be fine.

Surprisingly, Zich trusted Hans deeply.

>I've taught you, but of course you don't do that.

Of course, the source of that trust was himself.

This infiltration was much more difficult than the normal infiltration, as you must not kill the elves.

If the elves near the hostages die along with the raid, the 'iron clan' might doubt the connection between them and other elf clan.

>I wish I could catch a prisoner and make it fire.

But at least elves, even trained elves, are not tormented. I've experienced it several times before returning.

>They were dirty talkers.

Zich continued to move, avoiding the sparsely visible elves. And after a while, I was able to reach my goal.

An ordinary two- story building made of stacking stones . It was quite large, but it was not a special building in this place.

Zich began hiding in the building in earnest.

(Continued on next page)

No. 196 screen

A considerable number of signs were felt inside the building. But I don't know if they are hostages or not. I had to check it myself.

>Still, the possibility seems high.

Inside the building, the place where people gathered the most was in front of the door on the first floor.

Perhaps it was to be on the lookout for a sudden intruder. And, as if trying to find an intruder who might have been hiding in the house, there were a small number of people everywhere in the house.

However, what caught Zich's attention more than that was the motionless signs felt in the second episode.

>The three are gathered.

To be precise, two of the three were close together and one was a little farther away.

>It looks like one person locked in the room and two people standing on the guard.

It was like having one hostage in one room.

Originally, it was good to separate buildings for each hostage, but it seemed to be confined to one building because of the military problem.

When I counted three people in one group, there were a total of eight groups.

>There are five elf clan. One of them is the 'Iron Clan', so there are a total of four families taken hostage. Eight is correct if the king and queen are separated.

But Zich was not satisfied.

>Who is the maiden?

The mother of the king of the 'Lake Clan' and Leona's grandmother. And the purpose of Zich's coming to this Adrowon Great Forest.

According to Dronian, the only ones that even have a shaman are `The Lake Clan`.

The only other clans held captive are the king and queen. In the beginning, it was said that the existence of a shaman is only a being of the 'lake clan' who have 'tears of the lake'.

>Then there should be nine groups.

I had to confirm.

>Is there not one person, or is it not the hostages.

Zich carefully clinged to the window. And this time, I activated the new artifact that Lyla made.

>Because this guy is really a genius.

At the sight of his body gradually becoming transparent and his presence so low that he could not be detected even if he took a deep breath, Zich stuck out his tongue.

Its functions are invisibility and barriers, just like what Lyla once made in the past. However, the performance itself was different from the artifacts that were temporarily created in the past.

>Does it make sense to create something like this while traveling without a proper magic workshop or research facility?

The situation at the time of giving was also very absurd.

“I made it in my spare time when I thought about it a long time ago. Write well.' Lani.

And when he threw the bracelet, an artifact, he was stunned for a moment.

>If I was an ordinary man, I would have fallen in love right away.

Zich giggled for a moment and then looked out the window.

>You can't break through the window.

The windows had thick gratings.

Zich touched the grate. The texture of cold metal sticks to your hand. I grabbed it with all my might.

>I don't think it's common iron.

Presumably, precious metals were mixed to increase strength.

>I wouldn't have done this kind of money to stop a thief at least.

But I wouldn't do it for such an ordinary building.

>You're more likely to be here.

Zich jumped. It was hung on the second floor window sill and stuck to the wall. And it was quiet for a while.

>••• Is there anyone approaching?

No matter how hard you try to silence the sound, when it hangs on the window frame, it will inevitably make more than a certain amount of noise. Besides, the opponent is an elf with dirty ears.

However, fortunately, no elf noticed that he had been distracted by the noise from outside and the fight that took place in the distance.

Zich tightened his arms and lifted him up. Then I looked into the room through the window.

>•••I think I found it.

In the room, an elf was sitting on a bed with her eyes closed. It is not the king, queen, or shaman of the 'Lake Clan'.

Their appearance was clearly distinguishable because the Dronian showed them once before coming to 'Mentis'.

However, looking at his emaciated face and scruffy mole goal, he looked like a hostage. Above all, the clothes he was wearing revealed his identity.

“Are you the king of the mountain clan?”

It must have been seen that the figure of a majestic mountain was embroidered on the clothes he was wearing.

Zich went out the window like a monkey, checking all the rooms on the second floor. Fortunately, all the rooms had windows so we could see inside.

It was when Zich moved about the fifth time.

>found!

I saw a man who looked exactly like the portrait Dronian showed me.

>Is that person the king of the 'Lake Clan'?

And he must be Leona's father.

He looked a little haggard like everyone else, but he didn't seem to have any obvious health problems either. His color was good and his eyes were alive.

Zich looked around the rest of the rooms.

>The king and queen seem to be all here.

but one. The shaman of the 'Lake Clan' was nowhere to be seen.

>Shall we find another place? Or should I ask?

The hostages may know something. But then you have to reveal your identity.

>I'm not going to sell me to the 'Iron Clan', but it's a different story if I can skillfully hide the fact that I met the existence of the country.

Of course, as the king and queen of a country, they will not easily show their inner self to others.

However, if Zich does not talk to them, even a small risk that they will find out Zich's identity by the 'Iron Clan' can be eliminated.

At least, Zich did not intend to rescue the hostages immediately.

>It doesn't look like there's a problem with your life right now, so if you want to do it, you'll have to rescue the shaman at once.' With that in mind, Zich decided to step down today.

>The hostages may not know. It's not like there's no other suspicious place.

Zich looked at the castle in the center of the island.

By the time Zich arrived at the castle, the commotion had subsided. It wasn't a commotion to go on for a long time in the first place.

Rather than inflicting damage on the 'Iron Clan', it was more important not to discover that their true identity was just an empty shell of armor.

>Still, it lasted quite a while.

To Han Su and Snock, who made the operation more successful than expected, Zich lightly praised him.

It was not difficult to know that the operation was successful.

—Ahhhhhhh!

Because there was a shout from afar. Zich chuckled.

>That's him.

The person who led the 'Iron Clan', perhaps considered a general. His voice was clear.

>When I saw him in battle, his facial expression was amazing.

It was a pity I couldn't see it in front of my eyes. However, he soon brushed off his disappointment.

>Because this is not the only chance.

The bucket disappeared, but Zich did not withdraw immediately. Perhaps he would find the missing armor, and he would search for the mentees without mercy, so there was still time to spare.

>And it's hard to write that for a long time.

No matter how good the play was, it was difficult to keep hiding the fact that they were empty armor. In the meantime, I had to finish the chores.

Zich quietly sat down near the castle. I counted the remaining time of the remaining invisibility and anti-presence magic.

>That'll be enough.

Zich slowly infiltrated the castle.

The castle, which was built with straight stones, gave off a very cold image by gloomy reflection of the moonlight.

>It's a place that doesn't even look like an elf's.

Zich thought as he looked at the Douriban Douriban Castle. But now was not the time to arouse academic curiosity by thinking about the castle's non-elven design.

>If the shaman was caught, where would he be locked up?

Two things come to mind right now. A high spire, or a dungeon.

>And why did you have to leave the shaman alone?

It wasn't that there were no more rooms in the building where the hostages were kept. Whether it is irrelevant or important, there must be a reason why only one person has been excluded.

>Something needs to be used in their plans.

But that's something to think about after finding a shaman. Zich raised his senses to detect the presence.

>•••what?

Zich mumbled stupidly. He closed his eyes and concentrated more. But the result was the same.

>Look at this?

I didn't feel well. It was as if something was disturbing Zich's senses.

And I had never felt the cramped feeling of putting an eye patch on my eyes.

Right in the ruins of Violwin.

>Maybe this castle...

Zich opened his eyes wide and looked up at the ceiling of the castle. The ceiling, which I had to look up at for a long time, was embracing darkness and was looking down at Zich.

>Is it a remnant of an ancient ruin?

If so, it is understandable. Why did this 'mentis' not follow the elves' form?

>It wasn't about the elves in the first place.

Without realizing it, Zich stroked Windur in his arms.

As if judging that it was necessary this time, Windur turned into a small dagger and quietly slept in Zich's arms.

Zich smiled. I wanted to burst out laughing right now.

I hope you will discover a part of the ancient empire in this way. It was a very good decision to follow Leona.

But Zich soon suppressed his thoughts.

>No, let's calm down. Nothing is certain yet.

It may just be that he has the same power as the ruins of an ancient empire.

It could be that the old elves just built stone houses in cities rather than forests.

However, it was also true that one possibility appeared.

>I owe the elves a lot of debt.

As much as possible, he can understand this even if he robs and investigates this 'mentee'.

Zich moved again. But his actions were much more cautious than before.

>If this place has the same power as the 'Remains of an Ancient Empire', it can't be easily escaped when caught.

It is the ruins of an ancient empire that eats away both Lyla's space movement and Snok's power to handle the earth.

If you were surrounded here, you had to run away completely with your own strength.

But I didn't even want to just go out because it was dangerous.

>Let's go downstairs first.

When we think of the image of imprisoning someone, the first image that comes to mind is a prison, and usually the prison is underground.

>If it was a princess, it would be in the spire, but this time it's a shaman.

Giggling to himself at his jokes, Zich found the stairs going down.

The stairs were easy to find.

There was a staircase leading down the hole as if some stones had been lifted from the floor.

But there were very strict boundaries. Eight armed elves were watching the surroundings.

There is definitely something important. Zich approached the stairs cautiously.

Due to Lyla's artifact, the guards did not see Zich.

Still, perfect invisibility is impossible, and no matter how much Zich's skills and artifacts create a fantastic synergy and kill almost no presence, the elves' sensibilities are not normal.

Zich continued to sneak. And luckily, I was able to step on the stairs without any problems.

Zich went downstairs. Torches were blazing in the basement as well. It is a common sight.

Most of the basements don't get much light, so it's not unusual to secure a light source with a torch.

But Zich was interested in the torch.

>Too many?

The basement is not a very used space. They are mostly used as warehouses.

That's why they don't put too many torches to make light, no matter what. Especially if it is used as a prison.

But now, in this basement, numerous torches were illuminating the surroundings very brightly.

>There is also something.

Zich continued down the basement. Usually, buildings have a basement level just below the first floor above the ground . However, the underground stairs of the castle continued down endlessly.

At the end of the stairs, a very large space appeared.

And there, Zich was able to find the shaman.

(Continued on next page)


No. 197 screen

The space was wide and long. The high walls on either side supported the round arch-shaped roof and stretched long. It is only large in scale, but it is shaped like a passageway.

The shaman was at the opposite end of the entrance where Zich came out. I wasn't in good shape. She, like the other hostages held in custody, looked very pale.

Two armed elves with spears on either side of her were viciously watching over her.

And in front of her was another elf.

“You haven’t changed your mind yet, shaman of the Lake Clan.”

he opens his mouth It is a voice with a strong charisma.

Zich could at least be sure that he wasn't being harassed by anyone. In addition, the personality will be more rough.

The shaman opened her mouth to his answer.

After all, an elf is an elf. Leona's grandmother was unbelievably young and beautiful.

And the voice that came out when she opened her mouth was very beautiful.

“A bastard with no blood on his head squealed and fell asleep. It's better to call an orc mom and dad and be amiable than to follow you, you bald bastard."

>Pick up!

Zich was barely holding back the moment he almost burst out laughing. It is an insult that is a mixture of swearing and ignorance in a voice that is so smooth that it makes you feel like a beautiful song just by hearing it.

Zich once again looked at the owner of the voice. I didn't see it wrong. The portrait Drone Ann showed her and her appearance were the same.

She was 'Romane Wen Singh Zhu Draud', a shaman of the Lake Clan.

>Well, there's no way that a shaman should use only nice and nice words.

Perhaps even the spirits who communicate with her are character-breakers who spit out tea swearing like a meal.

>Anyway, I'm sure he's the kind of person I really like.

Of course, there was no rational meaning at all.

The elf who was watching her shouted.

“Disrespect to Your Majesty!”

>Oh, that child was the king of the 'Iron Clan'.

Zich knew the identity of the man in front of the shaman.

"Majesty? tell me? Oh yeah. The little guy who approved the head-to-head plan to bring in the kings and queens of other clans for a meeting and take them hostage? No, did you tell me that you made a plan like that head-to-head? what? Are you still pecking?”

“This one!”

The elf raised the spear upside down. It looked like he was about to hit her with a spear. But Romanne didn't blink.

“If you tell the king that he’s his subordinate, it’s a shame.”

I just added a word to enhance my character.

"stop!"

Renu stopped the soldier. The soldier reaped the spear. However, his face and rough breathing were still there.

“•••What is the reason for your opposition?”

Renu asked Romanne.

“Once we obtain this power, we can become the rulers of the world. We can even rule those humans!”

“To be precise, it must be the rule of your Iron Clan.”

Romanne sniffed.

“Don’t say that you’re going to give elves an edge over humans. Humans and you, the terrible and filthy things above us are the same.”

“The Lake Clan will give you the same authority as our Iron Clan.”

“With Leona as queen? a cub-like bastard. Find out your age and tell me. Don't you remember that you're the same age as Leona's father? Either he forgot my age, or he's a pervert who only likes children. Oh, by the way, aren't you married? Somehow, you said that you could not get married after becoming kings, are you just a perverted bastard?”

damn!

A loud sound rang out. Unable to bear it, Renu slapped Romanne on the cheek.

Her cheeks swell and blood runs from her mouth. But she didn't stop giggling.

“It’s violence because I have nothing to say. How can you not even see the magnificence?”

Renu grabbed Romanne by the neck.

“Cooperate, Grandma.”

"hate."

“Otherwise, I will burn your whole country down.”

“Try it. Do you think such sloppy intimidation will work for me?”

“I could cut all the elves in your country to pieces!”

“You guys are too young to be able to do it?”

“Ahhhhhhh!” Renu pushed Romanne away. She hit her butt and fell. But she was still calm.

“Looking at the situation outside, it seems that some humans have also come in. give up at this point 'Cause you're not going to do anything."

puck!

“Ouch!”

As Renu kicked Romanne's stomach, she crouched down. He was hit quite hard, causing severe coughing and flatulence.

“No matter what you say, I will get that power! and rule the world

I will!”

“Like you who used to be ruled?”

“mu”

Renu looked at her in surprise. Renu raised his body using his arms as support.

“Why, did you think everyone else in the other clan would forget 'the  thing'? Did you really think that you were the only one who was telling the story?”

"you...."

“The shaman of the lake clan is not just someone who communicates with the spirits through the tears of the lake. He is also a person who connects important events to the truth.”

Renu stared at her for a moment as if to kill her.

“••• Take it away.”

The soldiers grabbed her arm and forced her to stand up.

“Let it go!”

she waved her arm

“I go on my feet.”

Then I turned around and started walking. The soldiers hurriedly followed her.

Zich clings to the wall as if it were himself, watching her go.

"•••for a moment."

Romanne, who seemed to go up to the ground quietly following the guidance of the soldiers, stopped and looked back at Renu.

“Let me ask you one thing. who is this?"

“What do you mean?”

“I know a little guy like you. They try not to take any responsibility themselves, but only eat the fruits of others. You're a dirty coward."

“Can’t shut your mouth!”

The soldier next to her put a spear around her neck. But she didn't blink.

“When you think about it, it’s strange that you are trying to start a war like this. A coward like you would never be able to ignore the possibility that other clans would risk their lives and go to war. And if that happens, the Iron Clan will be thoroughly trampled on.

“•••What do you want to say?”

"who is this?"

She asked with certainty.

“Who encouraged you? How could a coward like you do such a daring thing... .”

“Can’t shut up!”

Whoops!

The soldier struck her with a spear. She fell, but Renu didn't stop her this time. He just looked at her with cold eyes.

“••• Take it away.”

"Yes!"

The soldiers dragged her after she lost her mind. Watching her disappear as if she had seen the enemy who killed her parents, Renu approached the wall behind him.

Just an ordinary looking wall. But within it lies a great power. Renu put his hand on the wall.

>If I can get this power, I can change everything.

A sense of inferiority towards the Lake clan. Inferiority towards humans. And even their past. You can change everything.

he bit his lip.

>I can't stay in this state for long. No matter how much we hold hostages, the power is too much. As the shaman said, other clans may sacrifice the lives of the king and queen and come out against us.

His eyes shone fiercely.

>If tomorrow she doesn't listen... .

Can not help it. Then you have no choice but to use the last resort.

It was when he made up his mind and hit the wall once.

“Renuant Dras.”

I heard a voice calling me. Who dares to call his name, the king of the Iron Clan, in vain?

He immediately turned around to issue a decree. But when he saw his opponent, he had no choice but to freeze.

A man wearing a robe was in front of him.

>Well, how do you come out?

Zich, who came out in front of Renu wearing a robe, felt his heart pound with anticipation.

This war may have something to do with Glen Gennard. Glen Zenard may have something to do with the assassins.

If all of those hypotheses are true, there is a high probability that the assassins are involved in this war.

Because of this, Zich used a strategy similar to that of Albus Winple.

Just putting on a robe and pretending to be assassins.

>The shaman said it seemed like someone was behind them.

If it's the assassin behind them, there's a good chance Zich's hypothesis is correct.

>Besides, when you hear about the guys behind the scenes, there's something strange about the reaction.

It was something different from the reaction when the hidden cooperative forces were discovered. It was as if he was offended by the mention of that collaborator.

The highest possibility for him, Sieg knew.

>You betrayed me.

It is highly likely that the Iron Clan betrayed its cooperative forces. And for Zich to feel, the Iron Clan also felt the fear of that power.

So, I came out wearing a robe. Now it's time to check how he reacts.

Whether those cooperators are the ones wearing robes or not.

Renu looked at Zich wearing a robe with bloodshot eyes.

“Renuant Dras.”

Zich calls his name once more. Renu took a deep breath for a moment. And he looked at him and smiled.

“Oh, it was you. I was puzzled because I lost contact for a while, but it's nice to see you again... .”

“I know you betrayed me.”

Renu, who was approaching him warmly, suddenly stopped. His inorganic eyes looked at Zich.

“I’m here to give you one last chance.”

“… What do you mean by last chance?”

“Come back under us.”

“•••You sound quite unpleasant. We know that we are allies on an equal footing.”

“It is the price of betrayal. And it's our last chance."

Anyone who sees it is a remark that ignores Renu and shows contempt.

As the king of his clan, it was even insulting to him, who always gave orders. Of course, his face had no choice but to rot.

“If you keep insulting me by saying things you don’t understand, no matter how much you guys can forgive me… .”

“Tell me one thing, Ronuant de Las.”

For the first time, something emotional was recorded in Sieg's pronunciation, which had been spoken inorganically without any intonation distinction.

“We will never tolerate betrayal!”

It was a sentence. Words like judgment spoken by a person with a mighty power on his back.

“But we recognize the importance of your plans. So, just once, for this one time, I'll move on without saying anything about your betrayal. So. Tell me Renuantdras”

Zich's voice hit Renu's lungs heavily.

“What is your answer?”

(Continued on next page)

No. 198 Tuesday

Renu moves his finger. He touched the clothes he was wearing once. Much better quality and precious clothes than others. Unlike other kings who were imprisoned and scruffy, their clothes were neatly maintained.

These are clothes that you can wear because you are the king and the winner. And he remembered the fate of his own, the Iron Clan.

Finally, Renu's mouth was opened.

"U.S… .”

He reached out to Zich.

“Did you want to bow your head to humans once more?”

Whoops!

Fireballs poured out of Renu's hand.

>Mightless magic. Is it really the king of the elves?

However, that was the only impression of Zich. Next to him is a monster that doubles the magic of no chanting. The monster was too great to be surprised that he had only seen the magic of no chanting at least once.

>Besides, the power is not good.

Zich took the shape-shifted Windur out of his arms and swung it around.

quaang

The fireball disappeared in half in vain.

>okay. This is the magic of the silent window.

The power and range are much lower than the magic that chanted the spell.

>Lyla's chanting magic is just as powerful as any chanting magic, so won't it.

It was nice to see the real silent chanting magic that he tasted when his common sense slowly shook.

However, that joy only swelled in his heart, and Zich continued his heavy acting on the outside.

“This is the answer.”

"huh! The Iron Clan has no intention of going under anyone! Now we will stand on top! Don't even rule you!"

“Do you think it is possible?”

"of course!"

"Right. Then good luck.”

Zich put the sword in his arms. Then he turned his back and started walking towards the stairs.

“You don’t think you can get out of here!”

Renu exclaimed. Confident voice. He is already feeling like he is the ruler of the world.

“There is only one exit from here. And the clan's troops will rush to hear the sound of the explosion."

Zich's steps stopped. Did he think he had finally felt a crisis? Renu's voice grew a little louder and more confident.

“There are ways to take me hostage, but at least I can protect myself enough.”

Zich turned his head.

“Your predecessor also died to us. Begging for his life at the end was an art. I saw it and realized After all, there is no reason to hold hands with you guys!”

“It was a good sight. Congratulations.”

But his tone was too calm. Renu groaned.

They were and still are, they are not human. cold and cold

It felt like he was looking down on him, so Renu really hated them.

Zich turned around and looked at him head-on.

Have you given up on running away? But no matter how he looked at him, he didn't seem to be in a corner.

“But, Renuant Dras. How much do you know about us?”

“Do you need to know that?”

"okay. I know almost nothing.”

In the past, he had beaten the betrayal and tortured the person wearing the robe he caught, but nothing came out. As he said, Renu didn't know much about the organization.

“Our contract was to let your Iron clan rule over the other clan. Isn't that right?"

"•••okay."

>I did too.

Renu caught on to the question he posed to the fact that in the future the Iron Clan would rule the elves of the Great Forest of Adrowon.

“Looking at what he is doing, it is obvious that he is not a peculiar thought of giving up ruling over other clan. Still, he threw away our hands. No, it wasn't to the extent of being shunned, but rather hostile. Then there is only one reason to think. The fact that we have gained some other strength to the point where we think it is okay to be hostile rather than holding our hand.” “And the power lies beyond the wall you stand on.”

M । »

Renu was surprised. The person wearing the robe in front of me was the first member of the organization I met after killing the person in the robe I had been in contact with. However, in that brief time, the opponent seemed to have grasped everything about them.

“Just one question, Renuant Dras.”

"What."

“Did you think that only that much power would save us from our wrath?”

Neither harsh nor hostile nor overbearing. There is not even a change in his voice, so it sounds as if he is talking about a calm daily life.

But when he heard that, Renu unconsciously swallowed dry saliva. Rather than yelling at him, his attitude, as if the future had been set, sounded more threatening.

But even so, Renu was able to answer with certainty.

"okay!"

“•••Then I have nothing more to say. I hope that hope will continue in the future.”

Zich turned his back and headed up the stairs.

“I would have said it! You can't run away!"

“Then you will be able to see my body soon. Then tell me one more time.”

With those words, Zich disappeared down the stairs.

As Zich disappeared, Renu took a deep breath.

>It's also a formidable organization.

We do not know their true identity, but considering the support they gave when they quietly prepared for war against the other clan, at least one of them would have been enormous.

In addition, those who wore robes that were worn at the ends were also strong one by one.

Originally, an organization that was afraid to even dare to fight against it.

But now it didn't matter.

>It's okay if you only get this power.

He swept down the wall behind him. It felt like the fear that gripped my heart was fading away. And the emotion that filled the void was anger.

>How dare you threaten me!

He waited for his subordinates to capture the organization's humans.

There's only one way anyway. And I spent quite a bit of time talking to myself. He had no doubts that the soldiers would catch him.

However, there was nothing in the hands of the soldiers who soon arrived. To the subordinates who did not even understand the situation, let alone catch the suspicious person, and asked what the fuss was, he had no choice but to spit out his soaring anger by shouting.

While Renu was arguing with the soldiers that they were incompetent, Sieg quietly left the castle.

>Are you going to catch me? It's funny.

Zich laughed at them. The elves did not notice him, who was still attached to the ceiling of the stairs after activating the artifact Lyla gave him.

After that it was comfortable. I had to quietly leave the castle to avoid the elves rushing around.

Zich looked at the castle. It looked a little different than before, as it was likely related to the ancient empire.

>I got roughly all the information I wanted.' I found out that there was a shaman in this castle. With this, I knew where all the hostages were.

In addition, unexpected information was discovered.

>These guys were also related to those wearing robes.

That was as expected.

>But I must have betrayed you.

Perhaps he found some kind of power under the castle that he was looking for and betrayed him.

>But I don't think there was anything like that before the return.

Judging from the words of the shaman and the words and actions of the person Zich saw, it was clear that Renu was a coward.

In other words, a very cautious person. A person who would rather avoid a risk even if he does not get a lot of profit rather than taking a risk for a lot of gain. He's a stability oriented guy.

However, such a person turned all other clans as enemies, and even the group of robes who were allies as enemies. It is not a stability-oriented behavior.

If so, has his outlook on life changed?

>It would be right to think that that power is that much greater than that.

Even turning all other clans and robes' organizations as enemies is not a great risk.

>But before the return, I remember that there was no such great power.

He's a guy who says that if he gets his hands on that power, he'll even subdue even humans right away.

However, at that time, the Iron Clan did not even attempt to subdue humans.

it was It was just suppressing the elves of the Great Forest of Adrowon.

>And if you have such a great power, you can't help but spread the word.

Humans and elves only interact less, not that they don't.

>It will be one of the two. For one thing, his power is not as great as his hopes.

But that probability was small. Well, if it's good, it's prudent, if it's bad, it's a power that a cowardly person firmly believes in, so there must be some basis for it.

If so, the next possibility  is the most probable .

>The future has changed.

Before the return, they could dominate the elves with the help of the organization, but now they do not need the strength of the organization.

>Before the regression, I hadn't discovered that power.

But then a natural question arises.

>why?

So far, the future has changed a lot. However, those are the things that Zich, who knows the future, put all of his strength into it.

Until Zich took power, people were faithfully following the path to the future that Zich knew.

>But it's too far from here to think that the future I've changed has had an impact.

Elves, who live independent lives away from humans in the Great Forest of Adrowon, were suddenly affected by the future Zich changed in the human world?

>It's unlikely.

Then I suddenly remembered Renu's story.

>They said  they were ruled by humans .

According to the story, it was highly likely that only the Iron Clan was ruled by humans, not the entire elves.

>Somehow, it seemed a little different from the other elves.

Unlike the Lake clan, which used a bow and arrow as their main weapons in a light suit, the Iron clan wore iron armor and engaged in close combat.

True to the name of the Iron Clan, I thought that the battlefield was Mentis along with the characteristics of the clan, and that the environment was completely different from the forest.

>Then, have they continued to interact with humans?

But it was also strange. Renu had a hint of shame that they had been ruled by humans.

And listening to the words, it seemed that the other clan was unaware of the fact that they were ruled.

>I think only the shaman knew... .

Then they wouldn't have had that much interaction with humans either.

>Then all I can think of is... .

Even though the Iron Clan betrayed those who wore robes and turned the other clan into the enemy, an existence that can overflow with confidence. And the existence that did not exist before the return, but appeared now.

>strength. Was that the variable?

A castle believed to be the vestiges of an ancient empire. And the power that seems to lie beneath that castle.

>Then it is most likely related to the ancient empire.

If so, what kind of existence is it?

‘Is it the same sword as Windur, Estelaide, or Tornium? But even if these guys are good swords, it's not enough to make them win the war.

To the last, the swords are meant to amplify the power of their master. I don't know about Windur yet.

>Then, is it the moving statues or black shadows I saw in the tomb?

If they are, there are some possibilities.

>Let's go back.

Zich turned his back on the castle.

>You can check later. If you save all the hostages, it's not a big deal to wipe them out.

Then take it easy and do your research. Zich completely disappeared from the castle.

Woodang!

The table is overturned and the objects on it are overturned. However, Renu who overturned the table did not seem to have been resolved yet.

He started trampling the fallen table.

“Damn it, damn it, damn it!”

Kwajik! Kwajik! Quajiic!

The table was brutally smashed by his kick. He stopped kicking his feet only when it exploded and shattered so that it could only be used as a fire extinguisher.

Perhaps that alone was not enough, he started looking for other things to destroy. The eyes that were spewing flesh were red and bloodshot.

But there was nothing more to break. The table was last. Beds and chairs, as well as various decorative items, were also rolling down the floor in disastrous fragments.

"Damn it!"

He kicked a piece of wood nearby and then commanded loudly.

“There is no one out there! Get rid of these and bring the others!”

The subordinate elves came in from outside. They did not react much differently to seeing the devastation in the room.

He just cleared the wreckage, paying attention to whether Renu's sparks might hit him.

The cluttered room became neat in an instant and other furniture filled the room.

The elves at work were very skillful. It was not uncommon for Renu to smash furniture in the room.

After the men left, Renu pulled out a new chair and sat down.

There were many things that encouraged Renu's character. No matter how they started, the situation that they were at war with the entire clan, the shaman of the lake clan did not listen.

And suddenly a horde of humans appeared.

>What the hell are they doing!' Humans appear like ghosts and disappear like ghosts. It would not be an exaggeration to say that they were the greatest variable in this war.

>Reportedly, they showed behavior like a simple predatory group.

It is said that they shouted out to find the treasure and actually searched the houses of Mentis. However, the situation was not easy to believe that it was straight forward.

>Is it related to another elf clan?

There is a possibility. They can't move properly because of the hostage, so they may be hiring humans to stir up the mentees.

But can other clan hire such a large human force in such a short time?

>It's impossible.

that was a bummer

It is said that even today, they stirred up the former mentees and disappeared like a ghost again. Not leaving a single prisoner or a corpse. If that's true, they're truly terrifyingly elite.

>It's impossible to hire a human horde of that size, but it's all extremely trained troops?

Gradually, the connection between them and other clans was fading.

And there was one more thing that made him rotten.

>And this time, even the robes!

No matter how great their organizational skills were, I didn't expect them to move with such agility. It's been a while since you killed the guy you were cooperating with, and you're already sending someone else to warn you.

>Besides, I missed him right in front of my eyes.

To be honest, the reason Renu made the room in ruins now was that his ratio was over 80% .

>Looking at his eyes, he seems to have grasped the power to some extent.

If so, that's an incredible amount of information. Renu's stomach was dry because it seemed that the power of the organization was much greater than he thought.

>It looked like he didn't care much about his strength.

If so, is the power of the organization really greater than the power it will gain? Anxiety grew rapidly.

>no. Calm down, Renuant de Las. There can be no greater power than that.

According to tradition, that power is said to be the power to burn everything in the world.

>okay. It's all set on fire. The lake clans, other clans, and humans, everything that is against us!

quaang

he smashed the table The new table split in two and fell to the floor.

Second already. But he didn't even pay attention to the smashed table.

>To do that, you have to get the power as soon as possible.' Other clans and organizations, and people who suddenly appeared. He thought that the organization might be the one controlling the humans, but he soon stopped thinking.

>It doesn't matter if they're part of an organization or not. It doesn't change that we're at a disadvantage.

his eyes were poisoned

>••• There is nothing I can do. I tried to take formal procedures whenever possible, but I can't choose the means and methods in this situation.

After all, the time he had to wait patiently was just until tomorrow. By that time, the preparations were all over.

>It's what you did. Romanne Wen Sing Zhu Droud!

He sharpened his teeth, thinking of the shaman who used to swear at him with a poisoned expression on his face.

* * *

“How was it?”

Zich, who entered the underground hideout, asked Hans.

“I didn’t hear it. However, it seems that the drug has gone up, and they are rushing more and more than yesterday. I don't think I'll be able to hide it for long."

“Well, I guess.”

There will be some people who think it's strange. But Zich didn't care.

“It’s okay though. We'll have to pretend we're third parties anyway until we save the hostages. There is no need to play any more.”

“You found where the hostages are.”

Lyla, who was quick-witted, immediately understood the meaning of Zich's words. Instead of answering, Zich asked Lyla for guidance.

As Lyla unfolded the map on the table, Zich pointed to the two- story building he had seen .

“I'm here. number is eight. I checked the kings and queens of each clan.”

“One is not enough. Wasn't there a shaman?

Zich raised his finger on the two- story building and flicked it across the map. The place where his fingers stopped was the castle.

“The maiden is here.”

“Only the maiden? Do you have anything else to write about?”

“You mentioned power.”

"strength'?"

Zich began to explain everything he had seen and heard to Lyla.

Everything from the castle might be one of the ruins of an ancient empire to the power that lies beneath the castle, believed by the Iron Clan.

Lyla listened seriously. From the moment the word related to ancient ruins appeared, from her point of view, there was no option not to be serious.

“Then you don’t know the identity of that power, do you?”

"I do not know. And you don't even need to know what to write now. If you save the hostages and blow them away anyway, you'll find out."

“Are you going to save the hostages right away?”

“You don't have to spend a lot of time on this. If you take a long time, variables may arise.”

And Zich added a word.

“I wonder what that power is.”

Lyla looked at Zich. Zich's gaze was focused on the castle drawn on the map.

Because it is a place where sunlight does not reach, Zich's shadow flickers on the torch that is lit. She swallowed her saliva.

obsession with power. That was the significance of the existence of the Demon King of Power, Zich Moore.

>Is it a coincidence?

So far, Zich has not shown much obsession with power.

All he did was do good deeds, good deeds, and wield people with strange eccentricities. But now, Zich was clearly showing interest in power.

>•••It could be just curiosity.

Isn't that the power that lies dormant in the ruins of an ancient empire?

But even so, the ominous thought did not leave me.

>Even the past self said that he couldn't bind himself.

I was relieved when I heard that. The devil means that you can go your own way without being bound by a bridle.

But on the other hand, it was also a dangerous word.

>It also means that you can turn into a demon king again without being bound by yourself to do good things now.

Lyla hardened her heart.

“Tomorrow I will make a fuss at the entrance and I will go rescue the hostages. Hans and Snock are the ones who make the fuss, and Lyla remains as a reserve force... .”

“I will follow.”

Zich averted his eyes from the map. Hans and Snock, who had been quietly listening to the operation next to her, also looked at her.

“If you rescue a hostage, wouldn’t it be better to send them to the other side of the lake by space travel?”

Zich stared at her face.

It's not that Zich didn't think of it either. However, it was convenient to move alone when rescuing the hostages, and since the hostages will be taken out of the building and moved to this underground space through Snock anyway, I did not intend to take Laila with me.

But Zich nodded.

"great. Lyla, you move with me.”

When Zich allowed it easily, Lyla was relieved.

>Perhaps he didn't allow it with much thought.

There is no need for Zich to cover Lyla's skills. And even if a dangerous thing happens, at least one person can be covered by Zich.

Because of this, I only listened to the opinion of Laila, who was not as self-assured as usual.

In the first place, there was no one with strong assertiveness in this party, except for Zich.

But for whatever reason, I was allowed to accompany you.

>You can never make me become a Demon King again.

It was for the sake of the world, and Laila liked the current Zich.

Although he occasionally swings people and his personality is garbage who enjoys other people's misfortunes, at least the things he's done so far, although awkward, were definitely righteous things.

>And it's true that you helped me with nowhere to go.

Lyla clenched her fists.

It was the next night.

Today, Kendis rolled his eyes and was walking around Mentis.

“Search thoroughly! If you find even a single ant, signal immediately!”

There were far more lights that made the mentees blush than the day before, and the number of roaming troops increased.

“If you can’t catch them anyway, you won’t be able to rest either! So, focus on finding one mouse hole! At least you should know how they get in and out!”

He continues to encourage the soldiers with a loud voice with magical energy.

The soldiers, united in their hatred for the unidentified group that kept them from resting, looked closely at the shadows cast on the wall.

But their efforts were not rewarded.

quaang

Fortunately, the door to a large house in an area with few guards opened roughly. The eyes of the soldiers were focused on it.

Whoops!

"Kak"

The elf who was close to the spear thrown out of the door was sewn with authenticity and fell apart. Before the soldiers could panic, a man in armor jumped out of the door.

“It’s them!”

“Enemy! Those armors appeared... , Whoops!”

The soldiers raise their voices and call their allies. But they were swept away by waves of armor constantly coming out of the house and lost their lives.

Once again, the battle cry resounded in the Mentis.

and that time.

“Looks like it has started.”

"okay."

Zich and Lyla were looking out of the building next to where the hostage was held.

The troops patrolling the surrounding area hurriedly rushed to the battlefield. Soon the outside was empty except for a few guards.

“Let’s move.”

Zich and Lyla left the building.

(Continued on next page)

No. 200 screen

Zich and Lyla hid themselves against the wall of the building next to them and looked at the building where the hostages were being held.

It had been a daring cover-up a little while ago, with a brutal surveillance force, but now that Hans and Snock have gathered all their attention and forces, they can afford it. Rather, it is thought to be spacious.

Zich sneaked up to the side of the building first. Two soldiers stood guard inside.

He couldn't do any harm because he couldn't even leave a trace that he came and went yesterday, but today is different.

Zich signaled backwards.

Whoo!

Something brushed the side of Zich's face and his hair was rustling.

An arrow of the invisible wind pierced the forehead of one of the guards. At the same time, Sieg also pierced another soldier's neck with a Windur.

“Cuckoo! Cool!”

The soldier, who had only spit out blood instead of a sound, trembled and fell.

The soldier who was hit directly by the wind arrow could not even make a sound and died instantly.

Zich threw the corpse into a nearby bush. Meanwhile, Lyla placed her staff on the dead soldiers and chanted a short spell.

In an instant, the figure of the soldier reappeared.

“Is that great?”

"not a big deal. It's just an illusion magic that projects my image for a while. If you look closely, you lose detail.” Hearing her, it was certainly very different from the soldiers who had just died. No, regardless of the appearance, even if you pay close attention, an awkward tee is evident.

Still, this was sensible enough.

I'm not going to pay any attention to each of the sentries in this situation anyway. Besides, I didn't have to cheat that long.

Zich put his hand on the door.

“Are you ready?”

“ O  ”

Zich carefully opened the door. He then showed two fingers to Lyla.

"Huh?"

"what?"

As soon as I opened the door, I saw two soldiers.

The two soldiers looked at Zich and Lyla, and their eyes widened. When he was convinced that it was an intruder and tried to make a loud noise, a wind arrow was struck.

👩👩👩‍👦

This time, it was exactly in the middle of the forehead. Zich ran quickly. But compared to the movement, there was hardly any sound.

He grabbed the corpses that were falling powerlessly and laid them down quietly. Then he gave a thumbs up towards Lyla.

The only difficulty was when they broke in. There were more guards, but unlike the soldiers at the entrance, they moved alone.

In addition, it was also seen that he did not pay attention to the vigilance of the battle sounds from outside.

There was no way those guys could stop Zich and Lyla.

“Uh-huh!”

Another elf spews blood from his neck and falls. Ji-ke, who laid her down on the floor carefully so as not to make a knocking sound this time, pointed her finger up at Laila.

It was a signal to go upstairs.

>The first floor seems to have been cleaned up.

Lyla nodded her head.

The two arrived at the front of the stairs. And it started going up slowly. Zich carefully pushed his head over the stairs to grasp the situation.

The doors were neatly arranged on either side of the straight hallway. Two of them stood in front of eight gates, a total of sixteen.

It was the room where the hostage was held.

>It's too much to deal with one by one.

Because the place where the guards were standing was a straight corridor with no blind spots, if someone died, the others had no choice but to notice.

>If possible, I want to deal with them all at once.

It is possible that some of the guards threatened the hostages by taking their lives or taking their lives.

Of course, it wasn't the blink of an eye, and I have the ability to solve such situations, but it was good to go safely as it was a hostage rescue operation.

Zich put his lips close to Lyla's ear and asked with a very low voice.

“Lyla. How many people can you deal with at once with your magic? With no fuss and the bastards won't even realize they've been attacked until they die. If possible, it would be better if you deal with the most distant ones.”

It's annihilation. Lightning, fireballs, or storms were enough to just plug it in, but the conditions that Zich put forward were complicated.

“•••Definitely eight. All if you risk a little chance of failure.”

But, again, Lyla was Lyla.

As long as they are protecting the hostages, they can surely kill eight soldiers who appear to be quite elite without any fuss.

And she calmly said that if you take a little risk, you can send it all away.

"great. Then you deal with the farthest eight.”

Lyla quietly memorized the spell. The soldiers did not notice. A fairly large amount of magical energy swirled around, but very little of it leaked out. Fantastic magic control.

Whoo!

The arrows of the wind flew. The violently swirling intangible wind drew an arc unlike before, when it was shot in a straight line. But the destination was still the same.

The guard's forehead, looking straight ahead without knowing anything.

puck!

There was a piercing sound of the skull, and there were holes in the four eyebrows. Their new models were torn down all at once.

The surviving guards hear the sound and turn their heads. At that moment, Zich moved.

In a blink of an eye, Zich stood in the hallway, in the center of the surviving guards. And he moved Windur.

It didn't even look right. Lyla's eyes could only see a few creepy flashes of light.

But the results were surprising.

Fight!

The remaining eight heads rise all at once and sprinkle blood around them.

In an instant, the 16 guards died without even knowing the words.

Lyla, who had been observing the situation while hiding on the stairs, asked.

“Is it over?”

"okay."

I don't even lower my voice anymore. Lyla came out of the stairs proudly.

Avoiding the collapsed torso, the rolling head, and the blood that continued to splatter, he approached Zich.

Zich went to the nearest door.

He pointed to the handle.

“Anything like a magical lock?” Lyla put her hand close to the handle and looked at her  magic for a moment.

"does not exist. If it's locked, it's going to be physical.”

Kwajik!

Zich simply broke the lock and opened the door.

No matter how quietly they handled it, they couldn't stop the sound flowing through the door.

But Zich calmly told Lyla.

"Right?"

“That’s right.”

The woman in the room was the same woman in the portrait Dronian showed her.

“•••Who are you?”

Seeing the corpse of the Iron Clan soldier who was imprisoned behind them, she asked with hope, but the boundary had not been cleared yet.

“Hello, Queen.”

Zich lightly bowed his head and introduced himself.

“My name is Zich. I am your daughter’s friend.”

She, the Queen of the Lake Clan and Leona's mother, 'Cydia One to Glorian', opened her eyes wide.

* * *

Zich gathered all the hostages in the hallway. They looked at each other's faces and smiled bitterly.

"Fortunately, it looks like we didn't suffer much."

“It was fine except for the food that was put together. No, it's been a while since I've had a good rest. It’s been a long time since I didn’t have the nagging of my servants.”

Is it really the head of a clan? Despite being locked up for a considerable amount of time, they were able to afford it.

However, they could not hide their curiosity about the person who saved them.

"okay. A friend of the daughter-in-law of the king of the lake clan?”

"That's right."

“You said you were in trouble because you ran away, so you brought in a good reinforcement.”

The king of the mountain clan slapped the king of the lake clan, 'Retri Perl  Hum Draud' on the shoulder. But Letrey's complexion was serious.

“Were there any other hostages?”

“Now that I see, the shaman is nowhere to be seen.”

When the others noticed that the shaman was not there, they hardened their faces.

“If you are a shaman, you are being held in the castle. I'm going to get you guys safe and then I'll go get them right away."

“You said only your mother locked you up in the castle? why?"

“I’ll give you an answer later.”

To the extent that it sounded a bit cold-headed, Zich cut off Letry's question.

“That friend is right. This is not the time to explain the situation to the enemy. Even more so if it's to save the shaman."

Said the king of the clan of the sea.

He also had many things he wanted to ask, such as the current war situation, but now was the time to prioritize escaping.

Letry and Cydia agreed.

Zich said to Lyla.

“Lyla, please.”

“ O  ” “o”.

"I'm checking to make sure no one enters the building."

I was going to be monitoring in front of the first floor door.

“Geek.”

Lyla called him.

“I'm waiting for you to come back

uh. Never go alone.”

" OK."

After answering plainly, he headed to the first floor.

There was no elf coming into the room, probably because the illusion Lyla had set up outside was intact. How long did you slap Windur on the shoulder and stare at the door?

“I went.”

Lyla came down from the second floor.

"the problem is?"

“No.”

"great. So now we just need to find the one left.”

Zich and Lyla's eyes focused on the castle.

Until Zich and Laila arrived at the castle, the battlefield cries continued to resound from Mentis.

Since all eyes on the island were facing that direction, the movement of the two was very comfortable.

“They are really good.”

Lyla admired Hans and Snock.

“They are talented guys. It's not like there's no hair around. I gained a lot of experience in a short period of time. Besides, from a teacher called me to an advisor called you. Those guys have a very blessed environment. Of course, you have to be good at it.”

But even as he said that, there was a hint of pride in Zich's voice.

The two quickly approached the castle. A total of four soldiers stood guard at the entrance.

“You enter quietly here.”

The situation is different from just before. Considering the size of the castle, there must be a huge number of troops patrolling it. In fact, they had witnessed a significant number of troops when they invaded before. It was impossible to kill all the troops in the building undetected, at least as when the hostages were rescued.

“ Did you say  you know where the shaman is ?”

"of course. When I got out yesterday, I figured out the location.”

It's easy to say, but at that time, the castle was literally in a state of emergency.

No matter how chaotic the aftermath of Hans and Snock's riots remains, it's a commotion in the castle where their monarch is staying.

However, even in that situation, Zich finished figuring out the location of the shaman.

>It was rather easy. Even in the uproar, the troops never moved as much as the room in which she was confined.

To Laila, who asked if it was difficult to search in that situation, Zich calmly replied that way.

If Renu had known, it was obvious that he would have hit and smashed the furniture in the room again.

“But for now, I’m going to look elsewhere.”

“Are you in the basement?”

"okay. Apparently, the king of the Iron Clan seems to be quite engrossed in that power. Also, there is a possibility that the shaman is making a fuss in the basement.”

Zich activated the artifact, and Laila cast a spell on her own.

Before becoming invisible, Zich took Lyla's hand. And he began to approach the castle.
