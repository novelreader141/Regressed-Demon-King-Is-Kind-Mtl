Chapter 201


As expected, the surveillance inside the castle increased because of the invasion the day before. However, there were few soldiers here as well for a place that allowed an intrusion once to see if it was possible to escape the effects of the battle caused by Hans and Snock.

The two entered the castle.

Layla clasped Zich's hand in tension.

'If it's really like the Violuwin ruins, you can't teleport.'

Where her last bastion becomes useless. Maybe that was the reason why Violuwin was driven to the point of being caught by the robes.

No matter how confident they were in their skills, the loss of the last bastion had no choice but to weigh heavily on their hearts.

But didn't she care? Power entered Zich's hand, which was holding her hand.

Layla looked at Zich, to be precise, the front of what Zich thought he was. It is invisible because of its magical power. I don't even feel a streak.

But obviously Zich was there.

'••• A really troublesome guy.'

While he was under stress due to his past, he did not even show the symptoms of Zich's abnormalities, but the fortress had indigestion.

But he's never been more reliable than this.

Layla proceeded to the castle with Zich's invisible lead.

Layla could soon find an entrance leading down to the basement. The entrance looks like it was forcibly drilled by lifting the stone floor.

There were more soldiers standing at the entrance than the last time. However, it was not easy to block the two with invisibility magic unless they overlapped their bodies and sealed them without leaking.

No matter how heterogeneous it appears from the outside, Zich's movement to lead himself by taking advantage of the inevitably created blind spots of the soldiers was so outstanding that Layla was deeply impressed.

Filled with tension, when Zich moved, Lila, who stood as she moved, and followed as she stood, was only able to breathe after entering the basement stairs.

'awesome.'

Had I been alone, I would never have been able to infiltrate like this.

Fortunately, there were no soldiers on the stairs. The two went down the stairs a little leisurely.

But for a while. As soon as she reached the basement, Layla had to raise the tension again.

“Am I right?”

Seeing the situation in the basement, Zich said quietly.

As he expected, the shaman was dragged down to the basement today as well. Even Layla, who had seen the portrait, quickly recognized that she was a shaman.

However, the situation in front of me was not a situation where we could have a conversation so leisurely.

The troops lined up on the left and right in the same room as the passage. The troops were neatly lined up with their spears upright, facing each other toward the center of the room.

And in the center between them, there was a small altar that seemed to be used for sacrifices. The maiden was lying on it.

Even pretending, her condition was not good. No, it was very serious.

The amount of blood flowing down the altar was enormous. The altar was already reddish with water.

A cold gray light shone through the ominous red. Perhaps that is the original color of the altar.

However, the original color had no meaning on the already bloody altar.

“•••Aren't you supposed to be dead?”

Lila put the worst in her mouth.

But it was enough to make me think so. The blood that flowed over the altar was already a lethal dose for a human being. But Zich denied Layla's words.

“That’s fine. Elves have much more vitality than humans. There are many cases in which human beings die from injuries and survive surprisingly well.”

Because he had experienced exhaustion before returning, he was able to speak with confidence.

“Of course, if I keep going like that, I will definitely die.”

Layla wanted to go and rescue her right away. But I couldn't.

“You can’t get through that easily, can you?”

“ O  ”

flaw •

Not 'probably' either. With confidence, Layla affirmed.

The place of the ceremony looked grotesquely distorted. Although the shape of the object was not completely invisible, there was definitely something obstructing the view.

said Layla.

“It’s a barrier.”

“Is it the sort of thing that automatically defends the ritual when it is performed?”

“Perhaps it will. Judging from the magical power it feels, it is likely that it will take at least a considerable amount of time to destroy it.” And during that time, Romanne was most likely to be killed. Or bleed too much and die.

“Well, did I think of those guys too easily?”

Zich made a sick sound. No matter how obsessed they were with power, Zich never expected that things would turn out so suddenly in just one day.

“So are you going to give up?”

“Of course not.”

Things just got a little more complicated and difficult than he expected.

Yes, just that. If only he could not overcome such an unexpected situation, he would have died miserably somewhere on the street as soon as he came out of the family, rather than reigning as a demon king.

“If you listen to the sound of your breath or your heart, there is still time to relax.”

Zich's hearing, which had become extremely sensitive by raising his magical powers, captured Romanne's physical condition. It was truly an elf's vitality.

“With that kind of consciousness, there must be a tremor somewhere.”

In the first place, the purpose of the ritual, and that of offering such a sacrifice, is clear.

It is different from the rituals that literally give you peace of mind, such as simply thanking nature, praising God, or communing with spirits.

Leila agreed.

"right. Most of the people who commit such absurd things are the same. In a way, they can clearly anticipate their purpose, so they look rather pretty.”

The power to achieve a purpose. Most of what they wanted was that.

“Elf, it’s also quite strong because it’s getting older, and moreover, it’s a ritual that requires the blood of a shaman. I don't know what the purpose is, but I'm sure there will be a reverberation of considerable power."

Then, no matter how much the barrier that protects consciousness, a momentary sway cannot be avoided.

“Are you planning on digging into that gap?”

"okay."

Zich listened quietly to Windur.

“Do you know how difficult it is?”

To say that it is a gap, the barrier is only slightly wobbly.

The density of the barrier fluctuates in an instant along with the fluctuations. But that's a very brief moment.

The barriers that move randomly and indiscriminately must be detected and attacked in a short time.

Besides, it doesn't have to be accurate. Even if the density is low, a barrier is a barrier. It requires more than a certain amount of power.

In a word, the eyesight to catch the cracks in the barrier, the speed to follow the fluctuations of the barrier, and the power to tear the low-density barrier in an instant. ' will be

Frankly, even Layla is impossible. I didn't even think anyone would be able to do that.

However, the entity holding her hand really likes to break common sense.

“Hey, Layla. Have you forgotten who you are with now?”

Lila could be sure. The fact that her troubling, filthy, but delightful colleague, who was invisible by magic, had a very confident smile.

“Yeah, you were like that.”

Half admired and half given up, she said.

“Then I will ask. I will prepare myself.”

" OK."

After answering Layla, Zich cleared his mind, opened his eyes sharply, and focused only on the barrier.

"•••done!"

I hear a voice filled with joy after achieving the goal. It is a voice that wants to turn that joy into despair by trampling on her face at any moment.

'You are the king of the Iron Clan.'

Naturally, it was he who was performing the ceremony.

He lifted the golden goblet high. Several bright red lines are drawn over the shiny yellow surface of the glass. It was a mark of blood that had flowed out.

It was a cup of Romane's blood.

He couldn't stand the frown on his face as if it was a treasure.

'Ah, I don't think it's going to come crashing fast.'

I wanted to see Renu's face distorted more than to save Romanne.

“Finally, our long-awaited wish comes true!”

Renu exclaimed in a wretched voice. And immediately Romanne's words followed.

“What is the long-awaited wish? A cowardly bastard that I wouldn't have thought of if it wasn't for the one to push my back. Or was it just that long time for you? Don't you look more like a ephemera than an elf?"

Zich really admired Romanne. Even if he shed enough blood to leave this world at any moment if he were a human, his mouth was still there.

There are very few beings who can receive such admiration from Zich in succession.

Renu distorted his expression.

“… Even when everyone is dying, the dirty tongue is still there.”

It was on the bad side, but he seemed to have the same feelings as Zich. That made Zich feel a little bad.

“Hong, but now all you can do is lie down like that and play with your tongue. You will die there, and your clan will become our slaves. You wouldn't have gotten to this point if you had cooperated with us."

Renu clenched his teeth and clenched his teeth.

“That’s it. Now that I think about it, I don’t think that would have been too bad.”

Did he finally lower his tail in the face of death? Romanne brought up a story that was different from what it is now.

But Romane was Romanne.

“I wish you were a little less sassy, ​​less cowardly, less annoying. Why the hell are you like that? disappointingly. If you were a little more upright, our clan and your clan would have liked each other.”

Renu sharpened his teeth. The fingers holding the glass twitch as if they wanted to kill her right away.

“… I will treat your clan as a real slave to you.”

“I think it’s unreasonable for you. Unlike you, who is a slave to the bone, our clan will be very rebellious.”

“Yeah, nothing changes. Watch me die there as I gain this absolute power.”

Renu turned his back on Romanne. he approached the wall. It's just an ordinary wall that looks like it's made by stacking bricks. It is neither painted with masterpieces that will blind your eyes nor with bizarre patterns engraved on it.

However, Zich increased his concentration even more.

At least I'm sure he wouldn't have done anything like that to decorate that plain wall with blood-painted paintings.

“Finally we get our power back!”

Renu exclaimed loudly.

“The power that the cursed lake clan stole from us! Our rightful strength! You will get it back now.”

Whoa!

Renu swung the glass and splashed blood on the wall.

That moment.

Woo woo woo!

A powerful echo echoed from the wall. What had so far been disguised as a plain wall by removing the shichimi and floating it full of blue patterns.

" Five?"

"uh?"

Not only Zich but also Laila were surprised to see it. Not to mention Zich and Laila had not noticed the wall at all.

It was a great camouflage ability.

“What is that?”

But as it turned out, that was Layla's specialty.

“It’s a seal. It's probably a seal that can only be broken by those who inherit both blood and power. Very sophisticated and powerful.”

“A seal that leads to blood and power. That's why I needed a shaman."

Perhaps it was highly probable that it was the shaman's ancestor who put that seal.

The soldiers who stood like decorations until now began to memorize certain spells.

The magic resonated, the walls shook, and the doors became clearer. Romanne's blood, sprinkled on the wall, began to shine at the same time.

“Now it’s over!”

Renu exclaimed loudly.

Koo!

The castle rang loudly. There was a big crack in the wall. The barrier of consciousness trembled.

That was the moment Zich had been waiting for.

fault!

Zich approached the barrier in an instant and swung Windur. Windur spread like a flash of light, striking exactly where the density of the barrier was decreasing.

Chewy!

There was the sound of something breaking.

(Continued on next page)

A ritual passed down to the Iron Clan from generation to generation. At least 58 Iron Clan Elves need the lives of the Iron Clan King, and the power of the Iron Clan King is required.

Above all else, a ritual that requires a large amount of blood from the descendants of the shaman of the sealed lake.

The ritual was the knowledge that the royal family of the Iron Clan had valued above all else. It was also a ritual that was never known and hidden from even the closest vassal.

A ceremony created using the power of the royal family to seize only one chance.

Therefore, when performing the ceremony, the barrier that spreads so as not to be disturbed also boasted considerable strength.

It is a barrier designed to reverse not only the power of the person participating in the ceremony, but also the power of the seal to be broken.

Of course, it's not invincible. Because this ritual was to break the seal, not to protect something.

However, it is by no means a barrier that can be easily broken. I couldn't even imagine that the barrier would be torn in a single shot.

But now the absurd thing happened right before my eyes.

It was a moment of sharp scratches on the glorious act of breaking the seal.

Not only Renu, but also the soldiers whose lives were almost lost due to consciousness could not stop the movement.

Zich ran to the front of Romane in an instant.

Zich was about to get away with Romanne, but he had no choice but to change his mind.

'It's more serious than I thought.'

Romanne has almost lost her color. Her body temperature felt by her hands was too cold.

If more blood escapes from here, no matter how strong an elf is, he will inevitably die.

So, rather than taking her out of the altar right away, Zich decided to treat the wounds first.

"•••you are… .”

As expected, even the underworld Romanne seemed to find it difficult to even raise her voice when her physical condition deteriorated to this point.

Instead of answering, Zich took out a potion and sprinkled it on her.

Her wounds were not one or two. Upon closer inspection, there were thorn-like things sprouting from the altar itself.

They pierced a hole in her body and drained her blood. And the blood that soaked the altar gathered and fell along the groove at the bottom of the altar.

It was a really stinky altar.

Her wounds heal quickly

went. However, her complexion was still as if it could not fill up the blood that had escaped.

But considering the powerful vitality of the elves, that would be enough.

However, even though it was said to be a very short time, the time was delayed at the altar anyway. The characters of the Iron Clan weren't the only fools watching the commotion in front of them.

“Catch it!”

Renu shouted. The men began to move.

The soldiers who participated in the ceremony were still motionless. No, they started dying one by one because of the side effects of the ritual.

However, Renu also had an army in reserve. The four elves, who stood as if protecting Renu, reached out toward Zich.

Aww!

Four magics swirled and approached me. Two were wind magic, one was fire and one was earth magic.

Fire and stone mixed in a maddening roaring storm had the power to send a few men to the underworld simply.

But when Zich saw them, he didn't even budge. For a magic shot without a spear, it had great power and had good compatibility between magic, but behind Zich there was a wizard who was far superior to them.

Aww!

Lightning from behind erased the rushing magic too easily. Rather, the elves who attacked Zich hurriedly avoided the magic.

Taking advantage of that time, Zich was able to step back with ease.

Zich poured the potion into Romanne's mouth this time. Fortunately, her blood color has returned a little. But she still couldn't move.

'Rather than lack of stamina, it seems like he paralyzed the body with something like a drug.'

Otherwise, I would not have been lying quietly on the altar that seemed to be very painful to lie down on. Looking at her personality, it didn't seem like that.

“Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to see what you've done as you die! So what did I say? All the things you've done will be useless!"

It was obvious from the sight of him spewing out these sounds at once after recovering his stamina to some extent.

“You are right. Because he knows that if he makes a plan, everything he lacks will come true.”

“Oh, I know you well. And when his plans don’t go well, he always gets angry with those around him.”

“Okay, I know. Garbage that takes anger out to subordinates if you are in a high position, or to your family if you have a family. I don't know if I'm going to die really quickly."

“One is fine. That little guy doesn't have a family. You've become kings and you haven't even got a wife yet. How can you not see humanity or humanity?”

“Hahaha, isn’t it a peculiar way of not wanting to leave behind his inferior blood? Ah, the person who doesn't even think about that is your inferior. This is what I was thinking about wrong. It was stupid.”

“It’s a bit rude to say something like this at the beginning, but you were wrong. It was a bit like that because it sounded like a maggot that eats dung also has thoughts.”

“Is that so too?”

“It was, too.”

Is it really right to talk for the first time today?

Layla, who was holding the elves in check, almost slipped her wand for a moment as they exchanged conversations so casually and crushed Renu.

So, how angry will Renu, the real party, explode?

"what are you doing! Kill them right now!”

The elves hurriedly drew their swords and rushed to prepare their magic at Renu's back, whose eyes were turned over and screamed at the whale whale.

'Hmm, let's back out for now.'

As long as you've saved the last hostage, there's no need to overdo it. I thought about running right in front of my eyes and taking Renu hostage, but it didn't seem necessary.

'From now on, other clans will unite and overwhelm the Iron Clan by simply pressing it down.'

It was the war I had been waiting for.

Koo!

Just then, the castle rang again loudly. The standing figures stumbled. Zich looked at the seal in front, savvyly balancing.

Kwajik! Quajiic! Kwajijijik!

The wall was collapsing. The wall, which looked like it was built by stacking stones one by one, slowly crumbled from above, as if ridiculing the person who built it.

And behind the wall was revealed.

Because the back side of the giant seal was broken and exposed, Zich and Layla were very curious about what was behind them. But what was revealed was a disappointing sight.

Another wall stood behind the seal, as if making fun of Renu who had hardened the seal. Even the shape was the same as the wall before the seal was lifted.

But no one looked at the wall and was disappointed. Because Renu and Romanne knew what the wall was, and Zich and Layla had seen it somewhere.

To be precise, I've seen the shape of the wall and the gap that runs through it.

“Hey, Layla. that… .”

“I think the same.”

The remains of Violwin. A secret passage opened using Windur as a key, leading to the cemetery of the ancient imperial emperors. The new wall looked just like that.

“Uhhhhhhhhhh!”

Looking at the wall, Renu went crazy. Finally, he saw what he wanted.

At this moment, he felt that all the insults, swear words, and sarcasm he had been subjected to until now were all in vain. Even the ill feelings towards Zich and Romane melted away.

As long as the seal has been lifted, no matter how much they criticize themselves, they are only lamentations of the loser. At this moment, he had a complete victory.

Because of this, he denied it, but as Romanne said, he was quite a coward, and was able to utter such bold words.

“👑👌👌👌 Lucky for you, scumbags. Until recently, I had planned to capture him and kill him with all kinds of pain, but he changed his mind. You guys can just go back.”

"what? You’ve become quite friendly, haven’t you?”

Jack was surprised.

“Go out and tell me. I'll give you one last option. Is it war or obedience? Oh, but your clan has no choice, maiden of the lake.”

He said, raising his chin and lowering his eyes.

“I have to pay the price for insulting me. Let me go and bring all of your clan. And resist it. I myself will crush that insignificant resistance.”

“Do you have the key?”

Romanne asked lowly. Although she continued to demean Renu until now, she also seemed to feel quite threatened by the power sealed beyond the door.

Renu said, feeling satisfied with her attitude.

“You don’t think there will be? If you like to believe it, then believe it. The despair that will come upon you later will only deepen.”

Then the soldiers rushed down the stairs. Surrounding soldiers rushed to the ground due to the commotion. They quickly aimed their swords at Zich's party.

But Renu stopped him.

“Stop it.”

"Yes? But, Your Majesty, you are not an intruder!”

"done. I promised to send Yes, let me guide you to the bridge. So that others don't attack them."

The elf who received the order had an expression that he did not understand. But a command is a command. When he beckoned to the other soldiers, they all withdrew their weapons. And I kept my distance from Zich and the others.

“What are you doing? not going fast. or what Do you want to come and surrender to us now?” Renu keeps killing me. Layla tugged on Zich's sleeve.

“Zeek, you better get out now.”

"Wait a minute. There is one more thing I want to ask you.”

"what?"

As if to answer any questions, Renu folded his arms and waited for Zich's question.

“If the power inside is so great, why don’t you open the door and show it to me? To be honest, I was curious from the beginning.”

“It won’t happen.”

The answer came from Romanne.

“I don’t know what the power inside me is. Perhaps that door will open gradually through another ritual. Controlling the power within.”

“You have that kind of head.”

“In the beginning, we know that bugs value their lives. Would you mind doing something like camouflage for nothing?”

“… Let me not test how long my mercy will last.”

“Look at me. It's like pretending to be a generous monarch saying that you've gained great power, and then ranting again because you've been cursed."

“It’s ugly. It's really ugly. No, it's really ugly. Can you be so ugly? He's the ugliest person I've ever seen in my life."

“These children… !”

With blood on his forehead again, Renu looked at Zich and the others with bloodshot eyes.

"good! So if you want to die here... !”

“Ha ha ha!”

It was sudden. Zich suddenly grabbed Laila from behind and flew towards Le Nou.

He was holding Layla and Romanne in both hands, but his speed was literally a ray of light.

Unable to raise a weapon, Zich stretched out his feet to Renu. It was a simple flying kick, but considering its power and speed, it had the power to crush a human head in a funny way.

Not to mention the soldiers who were besieging Zich and his party, Siegwa was a surprise to the extent that even Renu, who stood at the end of the room, could not properly recognize it.

However, due to the distance, Renu barely managed to avoid Zich's attack.

Aww!

Jack's feet hit the wall. There was a loud noise, but the walls were intact.

Renu, who was about to die, took a deep breath and ran to the place where Zich and his party were originally. The soldiers surrounded him.

The positions of Zich and Renu changed.

“Hey, this kid… !”

Renu trembled as he fingered Zich as if he was quite surprised. However, Zich only shrugged his shoulders as if it were a pity.

“Hey, this child! I tried to send you mercy at the best, but I will pay you back with a surprise!”

“You’re not dead.”

"Isn't that enough?" Turo Zich answered calmly.

(Continued on next page)

No. 203 screen

Abominable and shameless From Renu's point of view, of course, Zich was a person who couldn't be liked if he had to like him, but the more he experienced him, the more his image deteriorated.

“••• Surely not all humans are like you.”

"No way. There are very few talented people like me who are smart, kind, handsome, and have a sense of humor, not just humans, but across all races.”

He could feel Layla's piercing gaze from behind, but Zich ignored it. I didn't have time to discuss my aesthetic differences with her right now.

“Well, good.”

Renu said. Are you tired of fighting horses with Zich anymore? Surprisingly, there was even a kind of despair mixed in his voice.

"I don't care what your mental state is anymore."

If I paid more attention, it seemed that my lifespan would be cut by a hundred years.

“Anyway, attacking me means that I have no intention of escaping safely from here. Oh, okay. I don't listen to you anymore."

Before Zich could say anything, Renu stopped him.

“There is no hole to get out of. You just die here.”

Renu pointed his finger at Zich and the others. The army that was breathing life began to approach Zich and the others.

“•••I'm not saying I've been swearing at him up to now, but there must be a way out, right?”

Romanne asked. How surprised I was when Zich suddenly ran a kick to Renu.

What's more, the result was the worst case scenario: escaping became more difficult. For him/her, it was enough to raise doubts.

It was Layla who answered her question.

"Do not worry. Even though this guy looks like a reckless person, he thinks about everything and moves.”

"Huh? Did you?” Why does Zich himself express the question at Layla's words? Lila, who received Romanne's cold gaze, kicked Zich's shin.

“Well, I didn’t come here without thinking.”

Zich knocked on the wall behind him.

“I wanted to see what was beyond this.”

“What were you talking about… .”

Renu snorted as if it was nonsense.

“It cannot be opened without a special key. No, above all else, there's a high chance you won't get a good look if you open it. Wasn't this all information that can be known from the conversation between me and the shaman? Even though he's annoying, I thought he was a capable guy, but at the end he utters incomprehensible nonsense."

“What, didn’t you not listen to me? As soon as the king speaks, you turn my words around? Even a chicken head would have that much memory. Oh, is that too insulting? For chickens.”

“The Iron Clan is getting pitiful now. A person like that is also a king, and he must have bowed his head to serve him, right? how are you guys If you come to us even now, I will accept you as a refugee.”

It was really the two of them who did not stop for a moment, and poured out venomous remarks.

Once again, Renu's face turns red. But Zich didn't hit the chase this time.

“Did you say it was nonsense? not at all information from talk? I remember it well.”

Zich raised his sword. Whether it was a necessary situation, Windur, who was a good listener for the fortress, had the shape of a straight sword, as in Zich's image.

“There is only information here that you don’t know.”

👌👌👌👌👌

As if proudly showing off his true self, Windur's blades, like tree branches, bloomed splendidly.

Neither Renu nor the advancing soldiers looked at his sword.

Zich shoved Windur into the crack in the wall. However, neither Renudo nor the soldiers thought that Zich's actions would have any significance.

shudder!

Until you hear something click on the wall.

“What, what!”

There's no way the good ears of the elves couldn't hear it. It sounded like a key snapped into a lock.

And that guess was not wrong.

That's right!

As Zich turned Windur, a part of the wall moved in a large circle, just like it did in Violuwin.

Anyone could tell that Zich was opening the door now.

"No!"

Renu shouted.

I don't know how that human could have a substitute for the key. Now Renu didn't have time to think about that.

“This child! Didn't you say you remember the conversation? You never know what might happen if you open it now!”

“No, I know!”

Zich exclaimed confidently.

“He taught me.”

“Go, teach me?”

"okay. So I know. Open this and we'll be fine... .”

Zich laughed boldly.

“You will definitely be fucked!”

“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”

Renu shouted loudly. In order to eliminate even the slightest damage, the soldiers, who had been marching slowly in line with each other, rushed in, dispersing the heat.

But it was too late.

“Is that what you wanted so much? Open your eyes and look carefully!”

shudder!

ringing again. Windur made a full half turn.

After many years, the door to the wall that had been sleeping quietly was opened.

And what appeared beyond that was a disaster.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

A huge flame erupted from the door. It swallowed the basement in an instant and ran down the stairs to the castle.

But it didn't stop there either. Everything that touched him was burned, and it expanded its power in all directions.

In a very short amount of time, the castle is like a huge furnace that spews out enormous flames.

has changed

The time when Zich was confronting Renu in the basement of the castle. Hans was fighting hard with the moving armor Snock and the golems made by Layla.

It was very hard work, but it was difficult to lead only the roughly made golems and continue to face the elites of the Iron Clan.

Eventually, the armor fell down one by one. And, of course, their tricks were caught.

“This is not human! It's empty!”

"Golem! It's a golem! Just a puppet!”

“Aren’t you a human thief?”

At first, only a few noticed, but of course, the information spread rapidly. As the breaking armor increased exponentially, the number of elves who realized themselves also increased.

'Is it the end soon?'

As he slashed another elf rushing in, Hans sensed the end of the battle. But it wasn't sad.

'Because the time Ziek-nim asked for has already passed.'

He couldn't believe Zich, and frankly, the fortress was Hans who was afraid of stepping on the border of fanaticism, so he had no idea that Zich would fail.

'A lot of the armor was also broken, let's retreat slowly.'

Still, the armor was going to recover as much as possible. Hans tapped the ground a few times. It was a signal to Snock.

Quang! Quang!

Suddenly, the attack of some armor became rough.

It used to be Snock's armor that embodies the contradictory movements of being moderately aggressive and moving cautiously, but now it's completely different.

Whether the armor was wounded or not, the armor that Snok moved was literally biting the elves and drooping.

While Snock's moving armor was blocking the elves, the golems who were tasked with counting numbers from behind ran to Hans.

Hans pulled out a magic box. And one after another, they began to house the golems around them.

“What, what… !”

Kendis couldn't shut his mouth when he saw that.

It's only now that I realized Who the opponent was, and how on earth could so many troops suddenly appear and then suddenly disappear.

'Those who we thought were a significant number of troops did not exist. There weren't many real enemies in the first place!'

He was deceived by the golems disguised as armor.

'There are some exceptionally strong individuals, but that's all!'

Those exceptionally strong individuals directly bumped into them and made them think wrong.

Even golems that can only move from behind have similar skills to themselves.

'And those exceptionally strong individuals weren't even humans!'

quaang

An elf struck the helmet of the relentless attacking armor. The helmet fell helplessly from the armor. But there was nothing inside the stripped helmet.

There was no head, and there was only an empty space beneath it, protruding from the inside in black.

Koo!

However, the armor attacked the elves again as if someone invisible was moving.

'… Perhaps the real few are very few. if not… .'

Kendis's gaze focused on Hans, who was slowly putting the golems into the magic box in the middle of the enemy camp.

'It could be one.'

As Hans, he wasn't particularly laid back, but to Kendis, it just seemed that way.

Whoops!

Kendis picked up a bow and drew an arrow. Arrows were hung on the strings and loaded with magical powers.

Tuoung!

An arrow was shot at Hans.

An arrow with great power that can even pass through even a thick steel plate. Unless you're wearing full mithril armor, you can't stop the arrow with armor alone.

Whoops!

However, Kendis's arrow did not pierce the mean enemy. The enemy raised the sword and deflected the arrow.

The point of the fire was that the enemy did not stop storing the golems in the meantime.

It's as if you don't even need to do your best to block your attacks.

“Lee Lee Ik!”

Kendis continued shooting arrows. However, Hans' Estelaide struck all arrows. It wasn't even a narrow blow with all his might.

The legs are firmly attached to the ground, and even the upper body does not move. Only the right arm holding the sword moved and struck the arrow.

“Damn it!”

Kwajik!

Kendis picked up his bow and threw it. It was a powerful compound bow made by mixing various kinds of wood, byproducts of monsters, and even a little metal, but it was broken because it could not withstand the shock that Kendis threw.

“Attack the guy who puts his armor in there with the bow! Make me a hedgehog!”

If quality is not, quantity. Arrows that had been sporadically heading towards the armor so far flew all at once, aiming at one Hans.

It was dark and it was hard to see, but if it was a bright day, the clouds of arrows that flew at once would have been spectacular.

And it was as dangerous as it was gorgeous.

Whoa!

Hans concentrated his magic on Estelaide. The unique light of the holy sword flashed.

It is as if the sun is rising from the ground. Maybe the sky went crazy, and the time zone suddenly changed to daytime.

It was such a bright light that I thought so. Hans swung the glowing Estelaide towards the hordes of arrows rushing in.

Wow!

The first lights that ran out illuminate the surroundings. And what followed was a destructive flash full of Hans' magical power.

There is no sound. The light that filled the surroundings became bright like an explosion.

And disappeared.

In an instant, darkness fell on the world again. However, the group of arrows rushing towards Hans disappeared with the light without a trace.

The elves look at Hans with astonished expressions. It was the first time that Hans had shown the skills he had seen, as he had been playing adequately a group of human invaders.

But whether the elves were frozen or not, Hans simply did his job in silence. However, the sudden silence was also awkward.

'Well, I mean, if it's Zich-sama at a time like this... .'

At that moment, his eyes met the general who was leading the elf. He was also looking at Hans with his eyes wide open. But there were times when I could feel the unquenchable anger.

So said.

“Why are you looking at me like that? Did anything happen that would make you angry?”

(Continued on next page)

No. 204 screen

There was a different atmosphere from before. Whatever Hans said was a provocation. No matter how overwhelming the opponent was, that doesn't mean he wasn't angry.

Moreover, since Hans was still storing the armor one after another, it was immediately apparent that the opponent's power was diminishing.

Numbers are power and violence. Besides, aren't there a lot of strong people on their side? No matter how strong the opponent was, he did not think that he would lose.

Of course, the elves couldn't stand it. And the representative was, of course, Kendis, who had a horse.

"Something… Was it something to be angry about? How dare you say such a thing while mocking and opposing us so much!”

"Ah… !”

Hans scratched his head as if realizing something.

'By the way, most of Zich's words and actions are meant to provoke the opponent.'

It wasn't to create a gap by eliciting excitement from the other party, but it was an action to fill his own joy by raising the opponent purely.

Although Hans admired Zich very much, he had no desire to learn such a personality.

The current words just subconsciously imitated Zich's actions, and had no intention of provoking him.

'Taking lives is unavoidable due to each other's circumstances, but mixing insults there is a bit different.'

“Sorry, I was wrong for a moment.”

Hans politely apologized. That was his sincerity.

“If you think about it, the reason you guys are quiet is obvious. Are you afraid of my attack?”

"•••what?"

Hans is right. He was startled and frightened by his brilliant and powerful attack. However, there was no one who apologized and accepted what he said after sending out provocative comments.

I just take it as a further provocation.

"It's my fault. At the very least, I didn't know that you, the elite of the Iron Clan, would be so surprised by that one shot. Until it was revealed that I was the main power alone. It's my fault for misjudging your abilities. I am truly sorry.”

I store the estelaide and bow my head deeply. It is a respectful and polite apology from anyone looking at it. Even if the customs of the elves were different from those of humans, they did not know the meaning of their actions.

However, the wrath of the elves did not subside. Rather, it was much larger.

Behavior that does not go well with normal words or is extremely polite is no different from sarcasm. And that was the behavior of Hans that the Iron Clan saw.

But Hans was now sincerely apologizing to them. That's why I couldn't help but be taken aback by Kendis's roar.

“You damn bastard! You're talking nonsense with a hole in your mouth!"

“•••Are you still angry even after you apologized?”

At this time, Hans's expression looked very sad. That expression was enough to upset the elves' attire.

“The story of the Highness of the Lake Clan that the Iron Clan is too hot and dirty is true. I didn't just downplay the opponent just because he was an enemy."

These words were just muttering to myself. He didn't even raise his voice like he had done before.

But the bright-eared elves, who were all focused on Hans, couldn't help but hear him.

“Oh no, Hans. Let's not think that way. Now it's just an enemy, so that's it. It's probably just that you can't accept my apology because you're so excited that you've had a death-and-death fight. Reason and emotion are different laws.”

Hans murmured once more and smiled as he looked at the Iron Clan. A very kind and kind smile.

It was the elves of the Iron Clan who could not have imagined that such a smile would raise their anger and irritation to the limit.

“Yes, I understand. You guys still can't accept my apology. but remember I really, sincerely apologize.”

Now, looking at Hans who understood everything like a mother in her hometown, Kendis's last remaining reason was cut off.

"porridge… !”

It was time for him to issue an order of execution.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

A loud explosion was heard from behind.

Curry!

The explosion was so strong that the mentees themselves were shaken. Some soldiers lost their balance and fell.

But Kendis had no time to pay attention to the soldiers. It was the same with the other elves. Even the fallen elf looked at the side of the sound before getting up.

They, the great leader who leads the Iron Clan, is where the king resides. Mentis' castle was engulfed in a fierce fireball.

The flames that were constantly leaking from all the windows and doors were doing a splendid dance with the darkness as their stage.

“I, my lord… .”

Finally, Kendis spoke up. But it was frozen for a while.

“I’m going to the castle right now!”

He hurriedly started heading towards the castle. The troops followed him in unison.

No one cared about Hans. Rather, Renu's life or death was more important. Besides, don't the castles have the power they need to acquire?

The enemy in front of you runs out like a low tide. Hans didn't really stop them or anything.

His mission is over, and now all that remains is to get out. There was no need to pursue the retreating enemies.

He even retrieved the remaining armor and tapped the ground.

Hood!

A pile of dirt rose next to him, and Snock appeared.

“Weren’t you waiting in the basement for Ms. Layla to pick you up?”

“I don’t think I need to. Zich-sama also said that if you can get out on your own, you can go.”

“It was.”

Snock looked at the burning castle in the distance. The flame was so splendid that it immediately caught the eye as soon as it came out of the basement.

Of course, to the victim, it will only look like the tongue of a demon from hell.

“Isn’t that what Zich did?”

“Perhaps it will?”

That was the end of the question about the castle's flame. Neither of them said the same thing whether Zich would be okay. Their owner will surely show up with an intact face.

Their faith was soon proven.

“Did I say? He said he hadn't gone yet." Someone jumped next to Hans and Snock. It was Zich holding Laila and Romanne with both hands.

the shores of the lake. A group of people gathered and looked at the Mentis. The fire in Mentis's castle was clearly visible even there. It was such a huge fire.

A little away from them, the magic began to fluctuate. Through the darkness, a total of five personnel landed in the forest.

It was Zich's group who escaped Mentis due to Layla's space movement.

"•••Oh my gosh. It really has moved.”

Romanne looked at Laila with a surprised look.

In terms of spatial movement, it is not surprising to that extent.

It might be surprising that humans, even the very young Layla, could move through space, but there were quite a few elves who were able to move through space, which were longer than humans and were magically friendly creatures.

But even so, it only moves one or two people, including yourself. And as the number of people increases, the distance that can be moved naturally decreases.

But Layla moved the number five at once. It is also on the shore of the lake, which is quite a distance away from Mentis.

'Absolutely no ordinary wizard.'

No, it's not just the women who introduced themselves as Layla.

The man introduced by Hans had a sword that was not unusual even by pretending to be. Maybe your skills will be great. A man named Snock was doing the revenge of the earth.

'And a man named Zik.'

A person who literally made fun of the Iron Clan under the castle. Besides, if you look at his actions, he must have been the leader of this ridiculously rare and powerful party.

'What kind of person are you?'

They only exchanged names, but they haven't officially introduced themselves to each other yet. He said escape came first, and Lo Manne agreed.

However, he did call himself Leona's friend.

'Where the hell did this immature granddaughter get such a friend... .'

However, the fact that he saved her and introduced her as a friend of her granddaughter was enough to make Romanne have a lot of trust in Sieg.

“There it is.”

Where Layla reached out, the first rescued hostages stood escorted by the troops of each clan.

It was not difficult for Layla to hand over the hostages to the soldiers, as Zich already knew where the soldiers hiding near Mentis were.

And the rescued kings decided that it would be better for the troops to be united rather than scattered, so they gathered their forces in one place, and waited for the shaman who had not yet been rescued and watched the mentis.

They also seemed to have found Zich's party.

"Mother!"

"Mother!"

Immediately, Letry and Cydia came out. They tried to hug Romanne tightly. But Zich refused.

“It’s best not to shock Romanne too much right now. You bled a lot.”

"blood?"

Letry looked at Romanne's face. When I opened my eyes, I saw her pale skin.

It was not normal for anyone to see. Besides, her clothes were soaked in blood.

“It’s okay, you’re fine… !”

"done."

Pushing the frightened son away and encouraging the daughter-in-law who looked at her with concern, she stepped forward.

I could see the kings and queens of other clans approaching from behind. They all looked scruffy and haggard, but they didn't seem to have gone through a lot of hardship.

“Fortunately, everyone is safe.”

“Yes, Maid. It was just locked up, and I didn't get any harm. It seems that the shaman is a little different.”

When the king of the mountain clan saw the blood and pale complexion on Romanne's clothes, he said, The other kings and queens also uttered words of concern one by one.

Romanne smiled kindly.

“No worries. As you can see, it was saved safely. There were no wounds left. After a little rest, we'll be back as usual.”

The figure of Romanne, who calmed those who were concerned, was the kind shaman other people thought of herself.

Layla, who remembers all the insults and swear words she had done to Renu, couldn't help but feel awkward about her. But Zich didn't care.

Many people respond differently to different people. Besides, the person who swears at you is not the enemy.

'Whatever you do to the enemy is forgiven.'

Perhaps it was Zich's thinking that remained the most unchanged from before the return.

After talking to the kings and queens of other clan, Romane stood by her son Letis.

“What are you going to do now?”

The king of the clan of the sea asked a question. The queen of the mountain clan rolled her eyes.

“How are you doing? Shouldn't we go back and lead the army and trample them down?"

“Do I really need to go back now? Is it not enough to occupy the mentees with the current troops alone? No matter how good they are to defend, look at them. You probably won't be able to focus on defense."

The king of the plains clan pointed to the burning castle of Mentis. It seemed that he wanted revenge immediately.

However, the king of the clan of the mountain expressed opposition.

“Even though enemies may be in a state of confusion, the Mentis advantage cannot be ignored. Our troops aren't that great either." Most of the troops dispatched here were specializing in scouting or infiltrating because they had to follow the enemy's movements and, if given the opportunity, immediately execute the hostage rescue mission.

The power to fight from the front was inevitably weak. Even more so if the plate had to attack through a narrow bridge.

Even the king of the Plains clan agreed to that point, drooling and did not dispute it.

“••• Let's step back for now. And let's prepare our troops in earnest to defeat the Iron Clan." Each of the elves agreed with Letri's words, and the king of the plains clan also agreed.

Then Zich intervened.

"I'm sorry to interrupt, but if you want to attack, you'll have to do it as quickly as possible."

"Well?"

“The power that the Iron Clan was aiming for has awakened.”

The moment he ran away, Zich had a chance to look inside the door.

It stood tall in the great flames.

A large tree wrapped in vivid scarlet light and full of leaves of red fire flowers, not green leaves full of vitality.

It must have been the identity of the power the Iron Clan was aiming for.

(Continued on next page)

No. 205 screen

"strength?"

“Yes, power. The power that made the king of the Iron Clan prepare for war with the entire other clan, no matter how much he held you.”

The elves' expressions became serious. Some even cast their eyes on the burning castle.

“Maybe the flame burning that castle… .”

"Yes. That power is manifested.”

The power to turn that huge castle into a sea of ​​fire in an instant. It can't be threatening

Moreover, as an elf living in the forest, he had no choice but to feel more threatened by fire.

“But is the king of the Iron Clan alive? To be honest, I'm surprised we're still alive."

Layla questioned.

The huge flame that came out as the door opened was enough to plant an image of death in Laila for a moment. If it hadn't been for Zich, Lyla would have died there.

'Honestly, I don't know how we got out either.'

Layla closed her eyes without realizing it to the flames that were approaching.

But I didn't feel the intense heat I thought I would feel soon. He just felt something wrapped around his body.

A feeling of wealth soon after. When she opened her eyes, Zich was already running down the basement stairs holding her and Romanne.

The flames sweeping around did not approach them. No, rather, he was making way for Zich to run. As if they were not enemies.

But they were the only ones with special treatment. Wherever they went, they were strewn with elves struggling with fire. It continued until they left the castle.

Therefore, the survival of Renu, who would have been orthodox in the flames near the door, was very questionable.

But Zich answered her question adamantly.

“Alive.”

Before leaving the basement, Zich checked the side where Le Nougat was.

Similar to Zich, the flames didn't hit him directly. Perhaps he also had something to stop the flames.

“It won’t be okay though. It looked like the flames were 'playing'.”

Seeing Zich's smile, Lila realized. Even if Renu was alive, he would never be able to live with a good mogol.

Renu came to his senses. Accidents don't come right back. I couldn't remember where I was or what I was doing. It's like walking through a thick foggy forest.

You hear a mumble next to you. He opened his eyes.

“You are sober!”

“Bring more therapists!”

He sees his subordinates shivering around Busan. I didn't like it. People around me told me to always be calm and polite. Of course, he was far from such a civilized behavior, but he was a person who was tolerant enough to himself even if he was strict with others.

I have to issue a decree. Renu raised his eyebrows and made a loud noise.

“Ahhhhhhh!”

But what came out of his mouth wasn't a swear word, but a shrill scream.

“Ah! Aaaaah!”

The screams didn't stop. couldn't stop I felt pain all over my body. He screamed and struggled because of the pain, and the more he did, the more he felt the pain.

It was the reverse of a vicious cycle.

"hurt! hurt! It hurts!”

“What is the therapist doing!”

"portion! Sprinkle the potion first!”

The soldiers started pouring potions on Renu. As I felt a cooling sensation all over my body, the pain that felt like burning my body subsided a little.

“Huh! Whoops!”

Renu took a deep breath. The pain didn't go away, but it wasn't the terrible pain I had just felt.

It was such a pain that I really wanted to end my life right now.

'•••water.'

throat burned He looked around. His subordinates were looking at him with a worried expression. Among them was Kendis.

But for Renu, water came first.

Fortunately, there was water in a large basin right next to it.

Renu quietly pointed a finger at it. A subordinate hurriedly brought a basin.

Renu took the basin and plunged his face into the water. And I started drinking.

The people around him, who didn't think he would drink the water, let out a groan in astonishment, but Renu didn't care. For now, the first thing to do was quench my thirst.

“Pooh!”

He raised his face from the basin. Her bangs, which were submerged in water, fluttered and sprinkled water droplets around them.

As his thirst was quenched to some extent, Renu gradually returned to normal thinking.

'What happened.'

Obviously, he was fighting the intruder. Cheeky, annoying and hot-headed.

'Obviously he opened the door... opened... .'

And from that door, a huge flame came out. It quickly covered the basement and burned the men… attacked himself

"Ugh!"

Renu hurriedly got out of the flashback. The spine was cold. I really didn't want to recall the pain I felt after that. The feeling of burning my whole body alive was really dirty.

'for a moment.'

I had one bad thought.

The flames coming out of the door at the time were unusual. But, how do you manage to survive if you are caught up in it?

No, is he really okay?

I remember the pain I felt when I just woke up.

Renu looked down at the basin he was holding. The remaining water on his face was dripping into the basin, creating a gentle ripple.

But there was nothing wrong with illuminating his face.

That ugly, contorted face.

Ah… this… What is this?"

It was black, dripping, crushed, and tangled. His face, which was unique to an elf, and was so beautiful that it would not be awkward to express that he was beautiful even though he was a man, had completely disappeared.

All that was left was a terrible face and body that had been horribly mistreated by the power he so desperately wanted.

The elves held hostage once withdrew. They decided to return to each other's countries to stabilize the clan and form an allied force to face the iron clan.

Zich's group also followed the lake's clan back to the Draud Forest.

Dronian and Leona rejoiced over the family's return. In particular, Leona cried profusely in the arms of her mother, Cydia.

So the reunion ended. Since the arrival time was quite late, the meeting about the future specific work was postponed to the next day.

However, since the troops had to be assembled as soon as possible, Letry issued a simple order until a little late. Dronian helped such a father.

However, Zich's group, which had nothing to do with the clan's affairs, entered the room they had been assigned to earlier.

Leona wasn't there. She wanted to spend time with her family, whom she had not seen in a long time.

Zich's party returned to the room, but they didn't fall asleep right away either. I was thinking of exchanging the information I got from this battle.

They told stories of each other's experiences. No, to be precise, it was more like Hans and Snock reporting to Zich.

But it wasn't that Zeek didn't talk at all.

It was also the training Zich gave them to tell different stories and to weave the information to derive new information to use.

It's not a heavy atmosphere, but it's not an atmosphere where you're constantly joking around and enjoying yourself.

But this time, Zich had no choice but to laugh out loud.

“Hahahahahaha!”

Let the navel fall off Zich grabbed his stomach and squeezed his tears into laughter. Lila, on the other hand, was looking at Hans with an absurd gaze.

"Ha ha ha ha ha! So he's mad?"

"Yes."

Hans was explaining how the battle at Mentis had unfolded. The description arrived at the time of recovering the armor in order to retreat when it was discovered that the armor was not human but dolls past the height of the battle.

Zich showed interest when Hans recapitulated his conversation with Kendis.

Hans recounted the situation at the time and the conversation in detail. I couldn't remember everything, but I could remember the approximate flow of the conversation.

And this is what happened.

“It must have been difficult to accept an apology on the battlefield. Or that elf's personality isn't that good."

Jack laughed louder. He leaned his back wide and smiled, and then the chair tumbled backwards. There was a 'thump!' sound, but Zich didn't care. He rolled on the floor and laughed.

"Do not laugh! You made him weird!”

Layla beats Zich. But Zich still laughed. It was bent to the point of having trouble breathing.

“… What did I do wrong ?  ”

“No, I did nothing wrong. So, keep going... town! town!"

Layla closed Zich's mouth as he pushed the chair back up.

“I’m saying this because you didn’t do it on purpose, but your action was just the right thing to provoke.”

"is that so?"

"okay."

And Layla explained step by step to Hans what his words might mean.

Oftentimes, Zich next to him giggled and interrupted, but each time he kicked him in the shin and covered his mouth.

"Yes. If you think about it again, it was definitely a provocative statement. Why couldn’t I have thought of that?”

“Don’t feel guilty. It seems to me that there is only one obvious and unequivocal cause.”

Layla glared at Zich. Zich wrinkled one eye.

Lila grabbed a cherry on the table and threw it.

Zich ate the cherries flying at a fairly high speed with no difficulty.

He chewed the flesh well and spit out the seeds. And smiled slyly.

Eventually, Laila kicked his shin once more.

“Anyway, let’s be careful in the future. Even if the water is bad, it can be fixed enough. Hans, do you want to be a hero? Then I think you have to be a little careful with your tone. I'm not telling you to use a civilized tone, but you'd better not use abusive language or sarcasm."

“People who don’t know as long as they have the original ability and achievements are called heroes, no matter what their personality is… .”

“Shut up your mouth!”

Dudak looks at Zich and Laila, and Hans tells him to be a little careful when speaking.

I thought.

next day.

After a light breakfast, Zich and his group were invited by Letry. They followed the guide's guide to a certain room.

All the members of the royal family of the lake clan had gathered in the room. King Letry, queen Cydia, shaman Romanne, Crown Prince Dronian and princess Leona.

“Ah, here you are!”

Leona jumped up and greeted Zich and the others. Dronian sighed and looked at Leona's light action, but he didn't stop it or stop it.

Zich and his party all sat down on the chairs in the room.

“Once again, thank you. Thank you for saving us.”

Letrey gave an example. The same goes for other royal family members. Even Leona, who was smiling like an iron man, gave a serious expression of courtesy.

“I'm glad it was helpful.”

“I never imagined that my childish daughter would run away and bring people like you.”

Leona shrugged. However, at Letry's words that immediately followed, he bowed his head again.

“Still, I never ran away again.”

"•••Yes."

He had a bitter smile at Leona's dazed appearance, whether it was human or elf.

After clearing the atmosphere, Romanne opened her mouth.

“The reason I have called you all is because I want to exchange information about this event.”

As expected, Zich nodded.

“First, let me tell you what I know. However, I do not know everything. This fact was transmitted only by word of mouth from shaman to shaman, and as elves, it is a very old thing, so there are many things that are omitted. Please listen with that in mind.”

She caught her breath for a moment.

“Once upon a time there was an ancient empire of men.

It was. The name of that empire is 'Claw One'. It was a very powerful country.”

(Continued on next page)


No. 206 screen

ancient empire. Zich's eyes lit up. The answer to the existence I was still curious about may come now.

Of course, we need to hear more about whether the ancient empire he thinks is the same as the ancient empire Romanne is talking about.

“You seem to know a little bit.”

“I heard from Leona. There was an empire of very powerful humans.”

"i See. To the elves, it's known as a legend, but I did tell Leona a little more detail. That child has a high chance of becoming the next shaman.”

'Is Leona a shaman?'

Looking at the current image of Leona, who is more than active, I thought that it would not suit me very well, but Sieg soon stopped thinking about it.

'It's not strange if there's a shaman who is a shaman in the world where even a shaman is doing all kinds of double lust.'

And no matter how much Leonara is, she won't be left with such an idiot for the rest of her life.

Romanne continued the story.

“It is said that that empire, Cloone, was a really great country. An iron-clad force was built around the powerful emperors handed down from generation to generation. But it had nothing to do with us elves. Even though it was powerful, it was still an empire of humans. I thought it had nothing to do with us.”

“It’s tied.”

"okay."

Romanne nodded her head.

“Do you know all the names of our clan?”

“Yes, I heard.”

“With the exception of the Iron Clan, all clan names are derived from the topography in which they live. Of course, we, the lake clan, live in the lake. However."

Is what I say now really important? Romanne paused for a moment before exhaling.

“Actually, this is not where our clan lived.”

"Yes?"

" Yes'?"

Letry and Cydia asked in amazement. Dronian and Leona were also unaware of their blinking eyes.

'for a moment. The lake clan?'

Jack's head moved. Elven clans are named after the topography of where they live. Naturally, the lake's clan would live by the lake.

However, Romanne said that the place where he lives now is not where the Lake Clan originally lived.

Did you change your name?

'But what if you didn't change your name?'

What came to Zich's mind was a huge lake that he would have mistaken for an ocean if he hadn't listened to the explanation.

“Is there Mentis where the lake clan lived?”

Romanne's eyes widened.

“It’s amazing. Can you get to that point with just that much information?”

“Mother, is that true?”

Letry asks urgently. He was not even in the watermelon to be embarrassed by the secret that had not been passed on to the king.

"right. But don't be so embarrassed. It's been a long time already. Our home is this droud forest.”

After appeasing her son, Romanne started talking again.

“We were living in Mentis at the time, and Klawwin’s army suddenly attacked us. The Great Forest of Adrowon existed even then, but as if it was funny to that extent, they broke through the forest and attacked Mentis. And I asked for it. Empty the mentees.”

“There must have been a fight.”

“No, it was said that it could not be called a fight. At that time, it is said that Cloone's army was overwhelmingly strong enough to be called the spearhead of a god or a demon. Of course, the winner was Cloone. What's really surprising is that even with Cloone, the damage to our lake clan wasn't that great."

“•••That is amazing.”

The Lake Clan would not have given up on the fight. The enemy, even humans of different races, would not have desperately resisted when they were told to give up their place of life.

'In such a state, the fact that the lake's clan suffered little damage means that the Claw One Empire was a formidable group capable of suppressing even the opponent's damage.'

It really is a terrifying story. In the forest, the home ground of the elves, and the capital of the lake clan, you can suppress the enemy's damage and subdue it.

“Although he subdued our clan, Chloe Won didn't really care about our lake clan itself. Because all they wanted was a mentee. They cut down most of the trees in Mentis and started building their own city. So, the completed image is the current mentis.”

People held their breath and listened to her voice, which was revealed in detail.

“I didn't know at first why they needed a mentee. But rumors spread that they had some power under the castle they built in Mentis.”

“That power must be what we saw.”

Zich recalled the tree of flames.

"that's right. Cloone put that power under the castle and started managing the Mentis. However, no matter how great an empire, it must have been difficult to directly manage the Mentis in the Adrowon Great Forest. They put an elf clan under their control and entrusted the mentis.”

“That’s the Iron Clan.”

Romanne nodded her head.

“Originally, their name was not the Iron Clan. The original name is not passed down. After they came under the control of Cloone, they took human armor and weapons and managed the Mentis, and the other elves called them the Iron Clan, and they changed their names accordingly.”

“It seems that Renu is quite fed up with the domination of humans, probably because of what happened at that time, right?”

“It is very likely. In any case, they made Mentis and its surroundings their own land, and we were pushed back to this forest and established a new country. And the years have passed. Cloone took no interest in the other elves after taking the Mentis. The Iron Clan did not expand its power as much as it was given the task of protecting the Mentis. Well, it seems that there were a lot of conflicts with the other clan.”

Apparently, the relationship between them and the other clan who worked under the invaders couldn't have been good.

“But it didn't last forever. The time has come for the mighty empire, Cloone, to eventually perish.”

Relying solely on the power of Cloone, they are the Iron Clan who exercised influence in the Great Forest of Ad Loone.

And all around is their hostile elf clan. Of course, as a member of the Iron Clan, he had no choice but to feel a sense of crisis.

“At that time, our ancestors were negotiating. I hated seeing the Iron Clan look, but I hated seeing the blood even more.”

But, of course, the negotiations were not easy. It was rough at times, and it was always wrapped in a long guise, and it took a very long time.

But no one wanted to see blood, so in the end a deal was made.

“The Iron Clan decided to vacate the Mentis and return to their original home. But we didn't go back to mentis either. I'm already used to living in this droud forest, and the city that Cloone has transformed into their own way is an unsuitable place for us elves to live."

Zich remembered the stone buildings that had been filled with Mentis.

“So we made Mentis a neutral zone. He also sealed the wall through the power under the castle. Instead, we decided to take care of the lake’s treasure, the treasure of the castle.”

“Did the tears of the lake belong to the Empire?”

"that's right. A treasure with enormous purifying power and water magic. And, I guess, he must have had the power to control the forces beneath the castle to some extent. That's why the position of a shaman is only available to the lake clan. This is a position created to manage the tears of the lake.”

“•••I'm sorry, Mother. It's the first I've ever heard of them all."

As if tired, Letry squeezes her eyes shut and says. It was absurd when the heavy truth that even the king of the clan did not know came out of the mouth of his mother, a shaman.

“It has to be. This is information that has only been passed down from shaman to shaman.”

“But if it’s such an important thing, shouldn’t we be aware of it too?”

“Are you talking about thousands or tens of thousands of years ago?”

Letry shut her mouth.

“It is a long time even for our elves, who live much longer than other races. Even if the Iron Clan did not cause such an incident, it is an incident that we do not need to know. Our shaman is someone who manages the tears of the lake, so we just kept passing it on.”

Romanne sighed.

“But I didn’t know that the Iron Clan would continue to tell the story.”

“Perhaps they were always looking for opportunities. A chance to seize the power below the castle. Otherwise, there would have been no need to be persistent about it until now.”

“I think so.”

Romanne agreed with Zich.

“But why did it happen now? If they had intended to usurp the power of the Empire, there would have been opportunities.”

“That is my question as well. Why did they suddenly take action?”

“•••Ho, maybe… .”

Leona raised her hand as if she had committed a crime at Zich and Romanne's question.

“Isn’t it because I stole the lake’s tears? He said there was a possibility that the tears of the lake could control its power.”

“It is unlikely.”

Leona bowed her head. But Romanne added a word.

“But it may not be the case. No, it's more likely not. The time between when the tears of the lake is gone and when they get action is too long.”

“Besides, there are guys who encouraged me. They must be the cause.”

Before the return, when the Iron Clan ruled over the elves of Adrowon Great Shurin, there were no rumors about the power of the ancient empire.

'I would have ruled over other elf clans with the support of those in robes.'

But now, he betrayed the robes and was pursuing his own path.

"You're right. Who the hell did that?"

“I have a guess.”

The elves looked at Zich.

Zich gave them a rough description of the robes. He tricked Re Nou into finding out that the Iron Clan was allied with them.

“I hope there are people like that.” Letry murmured. Romanne also made a serious face.

“But their alliance is broken. At least they won't support the Iron Clan."

“That’s a good thing. But we must not be vigilant.”

"Yes."

“Most of what I am going to tell you is over. So is it okay if I ask a question now?”

“Anyway.”

“For now, that’s what I want to ask you.”

Romanne raised her finger and pointed to what Zich had placed next to him.

It was Windur. It was rude to bring a weapon, of course, as it was a place to meet the royal family of the elf, but this time, Romanne had asked to bring it.

“What is that?”

Romanne asked.

“You must have used that sword to open a room in the basement of the castle, didn’t you?”

"Yes."

“Is that sword related to Claw One?”

"I do not know."

“You don’t know?”

"That's right. I also picked it up by accident.”

Zich held up his sword. A blade-like blade that resembles a tree branch was lodged in people's eyes.

“But there is a high possibility that it has something to do with that ancient empire, Cloone. The place I picked up this guy is thought to be the other ruins of Cloone.”

Romanne exclaimed.

"What happens when you heat the room, life  had taught someone gave long. Maybe that someone... .”

“The shaman is also very quick-witted.”

Jack smiled and nodded.

"Yes. This guy taught me.”

(Continued on next page)

“Is it Egosword?”

“Perhaps I think so. No, almost certainly.”

The fact that Violuwin gave us directions in the past, and the information that it is okay to open the door this time, I thought that this guy definitely had a will.

'I change my appearance only when I feel like it.'

If you think about it, it seems that there is something like an old house.

Of course, he didn't seem to have enough ego to talk openly. The information you gave me this time was enough to make me feel that way. Of course, it was a certain feeling.

“It was this guy who protected us when the fire hit us.”

Even at the moment when the other elves were burned to death, Zich and his party were unharmed.

The elves stared intently at Windur.

“Do you have any guesses about this guy?”

Maybe we can find out something about this guy's clues. Jack asked. But Romanne shook her head.

"no. I know nothing of such swords.”

"Is that so."

Although the expected answer did not come back, Zich did not regret it too much.

“Once you said the ancient empire, Cloone? I knew about it, the Iron Clan, and its relationship with other elves. Now let's talk about that 'power'.”

“We don’t even know.”

said Romanne.

“What kind of power is that, and why did Chloone put that power on Mentis? Looking at Clawone’s actions, I can only think of him as taking over Mentis in order to retain that power.”

“I don't know if it was the 'power' I saw, but behind the open door was a large tree. But it was different from other trees. A tree wrapped in flames, the natural enemy of trees, cannot be said to be a normal tree.”

“A tree wrapped in flames?”

“Everything attached to a branch like a leaf was a flame.”

It must have been a very special tree just by hearing it.

Romanne said with a little thought.

“It was the flames from the door that burned the castle. When you think about it, it seems to have the power.”

“Well, then I saw… .”

Leona hesitated and said.

Mainly, Zich and the shaman were talking, and she stuttered a bit, as if she was afraid to intervene in the atmosphere as if the others were listening to them.

“Wow, we saw a tree in Violwin's grave too. Maybe that has something to do with it?”

“There is a possibility.”

Zich was also thinking, so he nodded. Seeing Romanne's eyes asking for an explanation, Zich opened his mouth.

“It’s about the ruins where I found Windur. There was also a door that could be opened with Windur.”

“Where was it?”

“It was a huge cemetery. Based on the information we have gathered so far, I think it may be the imperial tomb of Cloone.”

“You made a great discovery. But were there trees there?”

"That's right. It was like a tree that took root in the air and grew below the ground. According to Leona, I heard that there was a similar guy in the story the shaman told me.”

“Ah, that’s it.”

Romanne recalled an old thought.

“It may be an old story. Five trees with special powers. Among them was a tree growing upside down. Yes? Then maybe that too?” A tree engulfed in flames. It is a tree with special powers.

“I don’t know if it’s just a simple old-fashioned story. How did you find out about that story? And I want to hear more details.”

“You don't know a great story. It's just that, in legend, there's a tree like that that's coming down. It’s a story I heard from my grandmother some time ago.”

'I can't get any great information.'

However, I still got information about five special trees. Now we had to find out if there was anything to do with this information.

“•••The story has gone the other way. Let's continue talking about the Iron Clan's countermeasures."

said Jack.

“If that fire tree is not the power of Claw-One, nothing will change. If it is true that there is power behind the door, the guys who opened the door must have obtained that power.”

"•••From what I've heard, it doesn't seem like the situation has improved much." Letry said seriously. And Zich agreed with that opinion.

"That's right. They saved the hostages, but in the end, the most important purpose of the Iron Clan, the door, was opened. It is the power that made the Iron Clan betray other clans. If you think about it, you could say it got worse.”

“But you won’t be able to use that very power.”

Romanne intervened.

“I was digging up some information while he was begging me to unlock the seal. Even if you break the seal, you won't be able to wield that power. It was said that a certain ritual is necessary even when dealing with power.”

In that situation, he seems to have dug up the information by pouring out all kinds of abusive language.

“But it won't be completely defenseless. He said there was a way to pass the time.”

“In a nutshell, we need to gather our forces as quickly as possible and strike them down before the ritual of manipulating power.”

“While working out how to turn off the time he was talking about.” People got serious. What I thought the hostages had escaped safely and took a breather turned out to be worse.

"I'll have to send a messenger to another clan right away."

Letry sighed deeply.

5k * *

After a while, except for the Iron Clan, the elves of the Great Forest of Ad Lowon formed a union and gathered in front of Mentis. Military mobilization was surprisingly quick. One reason was the lake's clan's request to capture Mentis as quickly as possible, but it was also a major reason for preparing for war early when the king and queen were already taken hostage.

However, they did not attack the Mentis hastily.

The geographical condition of a huge island connected only by one bridge gave the defender an overwhelming advantage. Moreover, even that only bridge was burnt and cut off.

“You motherfuckers! You cut off the leg of the mentis!”

The past history of the elves. Anyway, Mentis is now recognized as an important land enough to open Puola. Naturally, he resented the elves.

“Really, the Iron Clan has made a decision.”

said Daniel.

Deniel, who was staying in the outskirts to check Leona's responsibility for running away and the human movement, was also participating in this battle.

He was burning with enthusiasm, saying that he would return to the Royal Guard by making a contribution in this war.

However, even for him, cutting off the leg of the Mentis was quite shocking, so he continued to mumble and curse the Iron Clan.

Zich looked around.

The Allied Elf Army is densely packed in the area in front of Mentis. However, since he was an elf, he was different from a human.

If you were a human, you would have removed all the surrounding trees and made barriers and campsites to prepare for battle. But the elves literally melted into the forest.

The only thing that came out awkwardly like paint that was unintentionally splattered on the picture was a row of Zich.

Whirick! Whirick! Whirrik!

A sharp flute sounded up the forest. The elf coalition, which was quietly staring at the Mentis, began to move.

“They will start attacking soon.”

“Did you say that the commander is the king of the plains clan?”

Zich asked Deniel.

"That's right. He has a lot of combat experience. The forest where the clan lives is close to the sphere of influence of humans. They live in plains that humans covet.”

Apparently, he had accumulated a lot of experience in war with humans.

“But it’s a little difficult. Even the only bridge was cut off, so we have no choice but to fight an amphibious assault.”

“If there was no time limit, we could just starve to death on the island.”

In many wars, countless soldiers died because of supply problems without even being able to fight properly. It doesn't matter how much experience or skills you have.

However, what was urgent now was the Allied Forces, not the Iron Clan locked in Mentis.

“Let’s prepare ourselves.”

Zich took out Windur and picked it up.

he grinned. It's the first time I've been involved in a fight between elves, but the fundamentals probably won't be different.

Clear blood and piercing screams will be mixed in the rough tension. And the scent of death to come.

It's been a really long time since I could join a war-like war.

'Oh, I'm looking forward to it.'

Layla looked anxiously at his back.

I saw.

“Chulbaal!”

When the commander, the king of the plains clan, commanded, the elves began to move slowly.

The elves crossed the lake in an improvised boat.

Those who were mobilized were the lake clan and the sea clan. Living near lakes and seas, they were much more water friendly than other clans.

Because of the distance, he did not get attacked right away from Mentis. As soon as Jin 1 left, Jin 2 got on the boat.

The Iron Clan in Mentis also discovered the Allied Forces.

They carried arrows and slyly followed where the ships were headed. However, the Allied Forces did not approach Mentis in haste.

While the first ships continued to circle around Mentis out of range, the boats continued to depart from the shores of the lake.

They were all boats made by cutting down surrounding trees and weaving them together, but a good boat was not needed to go from the shore of the lake to Mentis. Rather, it was important to have a large number so that the troops could be deployed at once.

There were more and more boats going around the lake. As a result, the tension between the two camps increased.

kuung

A loud noise was heard from the lake shore. it was a signal The boats circling the lake turned their bows all at once and headed for Mentis.

The tension surged. They pointed arrows at each other. The ships continued on to Mentis.

They came into each other's range.

“Shoot!”

Arrows were fired from both camps at the same time.

puck!

Kwajik!

“Wow!’’

“Aww!”

There were numerous casualties from the arrows. A powerful elf bow. A weak body alone cannot withstand the arrow.

with a splash!

with a splash!

The elves fell into the lake from the boat heading for Mentus. The red blood of the elves began to spread across the blue lake.

“Big billion!”

“Kek!”

However, it was not only the Allies who suffered damage. The iron clan was also suffering obvious damage.

Elves were hit by arrows all over their bodies and fell to the ground.

However, due to the difference between the Mentis, who has something that can be used as cover, and the ship that does not have any cover, the damage was bound to be greater on the Allied side.

However, despite the great sacrifices, the ships continued to advance. The distance between the leading ships and the Mentis became closer.

Whoo! Whoo!

Now the magic started to shoot.

quaang

"Ahh!"

“Aaaah!”

A ship that hit with a single fireball was shattered. The elves on board the boat were thrown into the lake.

But magic didn't just fall on ships. Magic also fell on Mentis, forcing damage from the Iron Clan.

The two forces continued to kill each other to the extent that I wondered if it was because of who killed more opponents.

That was the war.

However, objectively, the iron clan with the defensive advantage of Mentis seemed more advantageous.

The Allied Forces had much more troops, but if they continued to fight like this, the final victor would be the Iron Clan.

But the Allied Forces were not suffering.

Whoops!

A little far from the place where the battle was taking place, the ground in the center of Mentis rose like an explosion. And there was a hole.

A soldier of the Iron Clan who was running hard around found the hole. It was when he approached to check the hole.

Scratch!

A sword suddenly protruded from the hole and slashed the elf's neck. Zich came up, grabbing the body of the weakly collapsing soldier and pushing him away.

(Continued on next page)


No. 208 screen

The hole was connected to the tunnel Snock dug.

An extremely long tunnel dug under the lake and adjusted so that it does not collapse was a possible feat as Snok deals with the return of the earth. Even the width was considerable.

The Iron Clan only keeps the elves in check. The rear of Zich's party appeared to have almost no troops.

“Enemy, enemy!”

“The enemy appeared from behind… Whoops!”

Zich's sword cleaved the elf's throat with a loud noise. And it got stuck in the heart of another elf next to it.

Following Zich, the Allied Forces began pouring out from the hole. Among them were Hans and Leila.

Snok remained in the burrow to maintain and protect the hole. This was very important as this hole would be the only retreat in case of an emergency.

“Are you going straight to the battle point?”

At Layla's question, Zich nodded.

"of course. First of all, I have to help you land.”

In war, the number of pages is power.

“Besides, our enemies will be shocked and their morale will drop because of us suddenly appearing from behind. It will naturally become a two-sided attack.”

From the standpoint of suffering, it would be like hell.

“But I didn’t know you were so unprepared for a rear attack.”

said Layla.

It was not long ago that he mobilized armor to confuse the mentees. However, the enemy did not learn anything from experience, so he left it blank.

“Perhaps such a large-scale attack could not have been foreseen. Our trick came out last.”

“Maybe that’s why the image of ‘I can’t attack on a large scale from the rear’ has been hardened, isn’t it?”

“I thought they were wrong, but it turned out they were right. This belief is further  supported it firmer. They probably think that if there is an attack from the rear, they can only do sabotage by a small number of troops.”

That was soon to appear as a neglect of the vigilance towards the rear.

“I don’t have enough power to form a reserve, so there must be some things that can’t be helped. or… .”

Zich looked back. You can see the last name of Mentis. The castle, which had been scorched black because of a large fire, had now extinguished all flames.

“The 'something worth taking the time' said by the king of the Iron Clan could be quite credible.”

“What?”

“I don’t know. But you'll find out soon. If you don't want to lose, you have to give it up. But before that, we should reduce the number of pages of the opponent first.”

Zich started running with the elves running to the battle point. Hans and Leila ran after Zich.

The situation at the battle point was the exact opposite from before. The iron clan was bewildered by the sudden appearance of a large number of troops from behind.

The fact that they were attacked behind their back and the state of the enemy constantly coming from the lake side made the movement of the Iron Clan dizzy.

“Stop it! Stop it!”

Kendis shouted loudly, trying to keep the formation somehow. But gradually the number of the iron clan decreased.

Aww!

Layla's huge magic falls to the place where the Iron Clan gathers.

Several elves were caught in the magic and lost their lives. Even the elves who managed to save their lives groaned from their injuries.

But what was even more serious was that there was a hole in the defense line. The seasoned ones never missed the gap. And here, there was a Zich who did not lose to anyone as much as he experienced in war.

“Ha ha ha!”

He swung his Windur with a loud cheer.

Windur had already cut off the elf's neck, as the elf's action to stop it by raising the sword was futile.

It wasn't just one either. A total of three necks were caught in Windur's attack radius and floated up.

This time, I drew the sword diagonally. The body of the elf who was running next to me was two.

strong

arrows fly It looked like he was trying to contain Zich, who was running like crazy. However, Zich avoided the arrow by moving neatly with two feet.

Contrary to the Iron Clan's intentions, Zich did not move backwards. Rather, it moved forward and frantically slaughtered the Iron Clan.

"Ha ~ !"

Wiping the opponent's blood off his cheek, Zich sighed. It feels like emotions are rising. Seeing the opponent thoroughly playing with his overwhelming power, he burst out laughing.

Before returning, Zich didn't kill people for fun like other demons did. I did not choose any means and methods. So in the end the struggle against all began.

But Zich didn't think that life was that bad. He is the lord of power. The only purpose was to develop one's own strength.

However, the power you have cultivated is something you want to use. Because of this, Zich liked to wield his power on the battlefield. It was good to see the opponent collapse with the power he had developed.

And in the meantime, the battlefield itself improved.

'I miss you.'

As he cut off the elf's leg and put a knife in his neck, Zich thought so. Intoxicated by the scent of the battlefield he had felt for a long time, Zich moved his body like crazy.

It is different from before the return. You can't wield overwhelming power to break down mountains and scrape islands. However, there was no difficulty in enjoying the battlefield with the current strength alone.

“Turn it off!”

He punches an elf that cuts through Windur and pours out his intestines with his fist.

The elf, who was buried far away, tried to insert his intestines in a hurry, but Zich had already turned his attention away from him.

“Breathe!”

The sword was filled with magic power. Windur further amplifies magical power.

'It's also a good sword.'

I could feel the powerful fluttering magic from the sword. Zich smiled and swung his sword. Magic power was released along with it.

Aww!

A storm-like sword flew in all directions. The arrow that was being shot splits in half, and the magic that was flying explodes. And the Iron Clan standing behind him was mercilessly slaughtered.

They are slaughtered without covering their neck, chest, stomach, arms, or legs. In an instant, a pile of corpses stretched out in front of Zich.

“Ugh… ”

someone groans The current jig was really like a demon. It was a reaper who came to hunt them with overwhelming power.

'Who's next?

It was time for Zich's stinging eyes to find his next prey.

There was a kick from behind.

Whoo!

Zich swung his sword. This time too, Windur seemed to sever the opponent's neck. However, Windur stood still near the opponent's neck.

“•••What is it, Layla? It’s dangerous.”

Zich raised his sword and grumbled at Layla, who approached behind him.

“What's going on here? You agreed to provide magical support from the rear. Even you, it's dangerous here."

Zich said as he hit six arrows that had flown.

No matter how talented Layla was for a wizard who could handle sudden situations and even close combat, it was definitely dangerous to enter the middle of the battlefield.

Zich waved his hand.

“Get out of the way quickly. I'll protect you while you go. I have to run a little bit more…”

Whoops!

Layla grabbed Zich's hem. Zich turned his head again. This time, I looked closely at Layla's face.

A very anxious expression. The big eyes are shaking slightly weakly.

He wouldn't be afraid of the battlefield. Lila is a pretty bold character.

Even if he is left on a battlefield like this, he is not the type of person who will do nothing and sit down even if he swears and kicks other guys out.

But Zich knew when Layla had this look.

One has to do with her lost past. another one

"what. Do you think I will become the Demon King again?”

Layla didn't answer. just nod your head Her hands, which had become stronger, were representing her heart.

Normally, I would have laughed and joked with her so she wouldn't worry. But this time, Zich did not respond.

Along with his suspicions about Glenn Gennard, the idea of ​​doing 'good deeds' faded considerably.

Jack admitted. Now that he is, there is a high possibility that he will return to the time of the past Demon Lord.

'But is there any reason why you should not go back?' The things he did because he thought it was a good thing he wanted to do, and the things that made him even called the Demon King were actions he wanted to do.

I do it because I want to, and I don't because I don't want to. It was a very simple and sure way of behavior of Zich.

No matter what Layla says, if you want the demon to do it again, you can take Layla's hand away from here.

Even if she later turns into an enemy, she has no regrets if it is the result of her actions. Isn't that a jig?

But Zich didn't let go of her hand. I just stared at her indifferently.

Aww!

A slash of light passed by their side. The faces of Zich and Laila returned to the place where the slash flew in unison.

Hans was coming to their side. The Estelaide held in his hand was flashing with a flash of light.

"What's going on, you two!"

The two suddenly confronted rather than confronted on the battlefield of death and death, and they seemed to be curious about what was going on.

Zich looked at Hans.

A servant who dreams of becoming a hero with the holy sword Estelaide. As I think about it again, the countess raised a man who was arrogant towards him with great care.

'If I were to be called the Demon King again, what would happen to this guy?'

There is a high probability that the neck will run away in your own hands while stalking you.

'Snock will too.'

Zich looked at Hans and thought of Snock, then looked at Layla again.

“… No."

She finally opened her mouth.

“Don’t change.”

It is correct to say that it is returning rather than changing. However, it would be thought of as a change for her, who knew the knowledge of the future rather than regression like Zich herself.

“••• Whoo!”

sigh again However, the sigh of the present was not the sigh that was exhaled from the scent of the battlefield of the past.

"OK. I get it. Back for a while... Do not change.”

And waving hands frantically. It was an expression of falling back.

“•••Really?”

“Oh, it’s true!”

Zich shook his head.

If it were him in the past, he would have gone his own way, no matter what Layla said or not, whatever Hans was to him. Zich was also amazed at himself like this.

'Well, it doesn't matter. For now, I just want to listen to Laila.'

If you want to do it, do it, if you don't want to do it, don't. In a wide range, Zich did not change.

“Whew!”

Zich took a deep breath and swung the Windur. Again, the sword of enormous magical power was shot to the front and slaughtered the Iron Clan.

It doesn't seem like much has changed. But if you look closely, it is clear that Zich had changed from before.

There is no expression on his face that he enjoys, and he does not move intoxicated by the scent of the battlefield. They were just acting like other soldiers to end the war silently.

“Hans, take Layla to the rear!”

"Yes! Let's go, Layla."

Lila nodded her head. He looked at Zich's back and tried to fall backwards.

Aww!

But I had to stop. A huge fire was burning in Mentis's castle.

(Continued on next page)

No. 209 screen

Could it be that the power of the castle ran rampant again? But when Zich saw the flames of the castle, he stopped thinking about it.

'It's under control.'

It is not burning as if the entire castle is about to be burned as it used to be. The flames were clearly coming out of the castle, but the movement was definitely regular.

'Is the ceremony over already?'

Could it be that the information given to Romanne was deceptive?

'If that's the case, should I upgrade the evaluation of the King of the Iron Clan?'

But that's for later. I did not think that the sudden burst of flames would benefit the Allies.

“What do you think of that?”

“At least I don’t think it’s good for us.”

It seemed that Layla had the same thoughts as Zich.

Kwajik!

“Big!”

Meanwhile, the war continued. Sieg also shot and killed another elf of the Iron Clan that was attacking him.

It was a time when the war was going on for a while.

pooong

A large lump of earth rose into the air from the center.

“Zek! Snock's signal!”

Hans exclaimed. Layla also looked sharply at the lump of dirt.

“Something is coming.”

It was a signal that Snok would clear the hole when he fell into a situation where he couldn't keep it.

“Is this the enemy’s reinforcements?”

"Well. You'll find out soon."

“Can you check it by magic?”

"done. I'll see you soon anyway. More than that, Lila. You stick by my side.”

Whether it was the reinforcements or the unidentified power of the ancient empire, the existence of the rear disappeared with this. If so, it would be safer to keep it by your side.

“Hans. You keep attacking the elves behind you.”

"Yes!"

Hans nodded and started wielding the Estelide again. Brilliant brilliance embroidered the battlefield and mercilessly took the lives of the Iron Clan.

Zich also blew his magic and continued to attack the Iron Clan, alerting the rear.

It wasn't long before the enemies appeared.

“Hey, Layla. Do you know what that is?”

"Well. I do not know either."

Zich, who had a lot of experience, or Layla, who had various magical knowledge, could not figure out the identity.

It was a fireball. It is about the size of an adult male with one head more.

Like humans, it has two arms and two legs. The head was also raised, but the face did not exist.

The numbers were not alone. They were running straight into the battlefield, like soldiers charging at enemy soldiers.

“Lyla!”

"I know!"

Layla took her wand and began to memorize a spell. A tremendous amount of magical energy began to swirl from her staff.

Her staff pointed towards the fireballs.

Wow! Wow!

In an instant, the front began to freeze. The ground hardened and the walls were frosted. The leaves of the trees that stood there occasionally froze and cracked.

“Fortunately, the weakness seems to be as it appears.”

Seeing the movement of the fireballs noticeably weakened, Zich murmured.

Whoops! Whoops!

In the end, several fireballs burst out as they could not withstand the extreme cold.

Meanwhile, Lila prepared another magic. A spear made of dozens of water was created behind her. At Layla's will, they were shot forward.

Whoops! Whoops!

The spears of water pierced the fireballs precisely. A few more popped out.

Seeing that, Layla said.

“Are they like guys who aren’t that great?”

"okay. I also thought it might be a monster that keeps regenerating unless it destroys some kind of nucleus, but it doesn't seem to be that much. It won't be difficult to deal with."

Saying that, Zich looked behind the fireballs that Layla had dealt with.

“If it wasn’t for that guy’s page number.”

More and more fireballs were approaching behind Layla's disposal.

This time, Zich moved. Zich, who quickly narrowed the distance, collided with the fireball in front.

The fireball swung his arm and attacked Zich. The arms of the blazing flames stretched out in an instant and headed towards Zich.

Zich leaned over and avoided it.

Aww!

A small pit was dug in the ground because of a fireball stuck in the ground. If it was true that the soil had been charred, it was clear that it would leave terrible burn marks on the body along with the shock.

Zich swung Windur and slashed the fireball's arm.

Scratch!

pooong

The severed arm was completely gone. There was no such thing as a new flame coming out of the cut section and regenerating it.

However, as if he could not feel any pain, the fireball hugged Zich with his remaining arm.

It seemed that he was trying to burn Zich with his intense heat. But before that, Windur was stabbed in the chest of a fireball.

hooo

He avoided the flames flying over his head.

'Can you shoot fireworks?'

Flames radiating from what he thought was his head passed exactly where Zich's face was.

'It seems meaningless to stab the body.'

Far from presenting death, there is no sign of any obstacle remaining in the opponent's body.

Zich turned Windur around. The Windur stuck in its body rotated half a turn, and its blade pointed toward the head of the fireball. straight up drawn up.

Scratch!

Whoops!

The fireball exploded. Shaking off the remaining fire, Zich rushed to the other fireball.

'If you blow your head, you die.'

After a few more shots, Zich confirmed the condition of the fireball's death. I wonder if we can call their disappearance death.

“Aim for the head! Then you die!”

Zich screamed loudly and slashed the other fireballs. As Laila said, they weren't too difficult to deal with.

The problem was that this was war.

'You're pushing.'

After slicing one more elf attacking Laila from behind with a fireball in front of him and a bonus, Zich, watching the situation, felt that the war situation was not going smoothly.

It was good to attack the enemies from both sides with the ally who jumped out from the rear of the battlefield and attempted to land. However, the fireballs protruding from the castle were a problem.

The Allied Forces attacking the rear of the Iron Clan was attacked from the rear.

A situation in which the Iron Clan and part of the Allied Forces were attacked from both sides. But, after all, this is the enemy's stronghold.

In addition, one axis of the Allied Forces is being forced into an unfavorable battle called an amphibious warfare across the lake.

'I'm here.'

Zich realized that this battle would not be successful. just as expected.

"retreat! Retreat!”

A retreat order was issued from the Allied Forces.

'After all, I couldn't stand it.'

But it is still very important from now on. In war, it is important not only to fight well, but also to retreat well.

'The problem is that this is the worst place to retreat.'

Your camp is beyond the lake. And the island we are on now is the enemy territory.

The natural advantage of an island floating on the lake made the attack very difficult, but the retreat made even more a nightmare.

"how will we do it?"

Layla asked. Zich listened to Windur.

“First, we have to break through the guys in front of us and meet our allies in the lake.”

The commander of the Allied Forces also had the same life as Zich.

The attack on the Iron Clan was even more intense to deal with the fireball that appeared from the rear with only a minimum number of troops.

“Hans, take good care of Layla.”

"Yes!"

“Lyla. One large room in the front.”

"okay."

Once again, Layla raised her wand.

Whoops!

A huge ball of fire rose above Layla's staff. Seeing this, other members of the Iron Clan began to target Zich and the others. From anyone's point of view, Layla's flame seemed unusual.

However, Zich and Hans nullified all of those attacks. The iron clan's interruption ended without success, and Layla's magic was completed.

The fireball fell.

Aww!

This time it was a lot of effort, so the fireball erased part of the Iron Clan's camp. Of course, there were many elves who escaped, but there were certainly many elves who got caught in the magic and died instantly.

Besides, the important thing is not that the opponent does a lot of damage. It was that the opposing camp had collapsed even thinly.

Zich ran into the camp. It was swung in all directions with magical energy put into Windur.

“Great!”

“Kaak!”

The damage of the Iron Clan increased. Many elves tried to stop him, but he did not stop.

Rather than intensifying the opponent's damage, he chose to move forward one step at a time.

“Follow that man!”

Seeing this, the general of the Allied Forces shouted loudly.

Zich was literally creating a rift in the opponent's camp. Of course, the thinned camp is easy to penetrate.

The Allied Forces continued to pour in behind Zich. Layla also attacked the front with a magic attack, making the camp sparse, and Hans also swung Estelaide in a row.

The rift grew larger and the camp of the Iron Clan loosened, and eventually the camp of the Iron Clan split in two.

There was a lake in front of me.

“Wow!”

“The road has come!”

The Allies continued to push through the passageway between the Iron Clan.

The Iron Clan did not stand still. He continued to press to cut the passage and re-divide the Allied forces.

But the Allies were not pushed. The Allied Forces on board also helped their allies with bows and magic.

The Allies dragged their ships back to the lake. And after picking up his colleagues, he left when the number was full.

However, that alone was not enough to force the large number of Allied forces to retreat.

Zich was a little away from the battlefield and struck the ground with a certain rhythm.

Whoops!

In an instant, a hole was dug next to him. Snock poked his face out of the hole.

Knowing stood above his head and looked around to see if there was any danger.

“  Are you well  connected?”

"Yes! And the hole we drilled all the way to the center of the lake is definitely filled!”

At Snock's confident answer, Zich nodded satisfactorily.

“Send a signal.”

"Yes!"

Once again, a lump of dirt rose into the air. On the battlefield, the figure was clearly seen.

“There! There's a new tunnel over there! Those who are close, evacuate to the cave!”

The commander, noticing the pre-determined signal for retreat, shouted loudly. The nearby elves ran into the den.

They ran through the burrow as quickly as possible. This is because if you delay, the entrance will be blocked and your colleagues' retreat may be delayed even more.

However, no matter how successfully they broke through the camp of the Iron Clan and joined other allies, even if an escape route called a tunnel was created, the fact that this was the enemy's stronghold and an island did not disappear. And that they are on a rout.

“Aww!”

To support the retreat of the allies, an Allied force blocking the enemy's fierce attack from behind was pierced by flames and collapsed.

Next to it, an elf whose forehead was pierced by an arrow shot by the Iron Clan died.

Even as they gradually retreated, the damage of the Allied Forces increased.

But even that has an end. The ship of the last survivor of the Allied Forces left for the lake. But the ship wasn't that lucky.

Aww!

Several fireballs that followed to the shore of the lake blew out flames at the boat. The exhausted and wounded elves could not stop the attack, and the ship eventually sank.

That was the last time. In the distance, you could see the Allied Forces retreating by boat, but there were no Allied Forces left on the island. The tunnel, which was one of the allied retreat routes, was also quietly closed and locked.

The first battle of the Iron Clan of the Allied Forces ended with a victory for the Iron Clan.

(Continued on next page)

The mood of the Allied Forces was not good. The damage wasn't that great. But that doesn't change the fact that he lost the first battle.

In addition, the presence of the bizarre fireballs, the enemy reinforcements, was a factor that eroded their morale.

But that doesn't mean the war is over.

The elves quietly adjusted themselves and prepared for the next battle. And it was the same with Zich's group.

Surrounding the bonfire, Zeeg and his party were sitting. No one was seriously injured, but fatigue was inevitable.

It was only natural that Hans quarreled with the elves on the front lines, Layla was pouring out her magic, and Snock built and maintained a large tunnel.

But none of the three were sleeping.

Whoo!

A wave of magical power erupted near them. Hans and Snock jumped up.

chin!

In the wave of magic, Zich walked out.

“Are you here!”

"okay."

Zich, who answered Hans, handed the artifact to Layla. It was an artifact of teleportation that could be said to be Layla's trump card.

There is something to check, and it was a loan that she lent for a while for Zich who remained in Mentis.

It was also proof that she trusts Sieg enough to lend her precious artifacts without hesitation.

“Well written.”

"how was it?"

Zich shook his head nervously.

“It is unreasonable to infiltrate the castle like before.”

Zich floundered in front of the bonfire. Hans and Snock also took their seats.

“Were you under surveillance?”

“Even if surveillance is severe. But as soon as I infiltrated the castle, the troops rushed to me. I tried a few times, but every time it got stuck.”

“Did you use invisibility or vanishing artifacts?”

"of course."

“Is it still impossible?”

If the artifacts of invisibility and vanishing are combined with that of Zich's ability, a really great synergy effect comes out.

Even when he rescued Romanne, even in the castle that was full of surveillance, he moved in and out of his house, disabling the surveillance.

“It seems that it is impossible to sneak in after waking up from that power.”

“It’s a really annoying force.”

Layla grumbled.

"done. Even if they assassinate the King of the Iron Clan anyway, there is no guarantee that those guys will stop. No, if you’ve come this far, the king’s death would already be a trivial matter.”

For this reason, Zich did not regret too much even though it was thought that Renu's assassination was no longer possible.

“How is the atmosphere?”

"Not good."

Hans answered Zich's question.

“I lost the battle, so it must be.” But it was not a war without results. Most of all, I was sure that what Renu said was something that would hold the time until the ceremony was over.

Layla asked Zich.

“What are you going to do next?”

"Well. The Allied Command will come up with an answer.”

“Come to think of it, I found Zich at the headquarters. He said that he would like to stop by the headquarters for future discussions.”

Hans reported the message.

“This is really hard for a popular person.”

Zich shook his head and stood up again.

“Don’t go away for a second. You guys are sleeping first.”

"Yes!"

"all right!"

As soon as Zich left for headquarters, Hans and Snock started smoking blankets.

Obviously tired, the two fell asleep almost immediately after lying down. But unlike the two, Lila did not sleep. He stared at the bonfire with his eyes open.

It was after some time had passed that Zich returned.

“Aren’t you sleeping?”

Seeing Leila awake, Zich asked. Layla stood up.

“Let’s talk for a second.”

Zich looked at Layla's face for a moment and then nodded.

"great."

Layla led Zich out of the camp. Being aware of the sensitive ears of the elves, they went out to a fairly distant place.

As she was walking in the front, she turned around. I looked straight at Jack.

“You know what I’m going to say?”

"Sure. Isn’t it because I think I’m going to change like a demon king?”

“Are you going to change?”

Her voice was serious. Even in her sparsely punctured memories, the figure of the Demon King of Power Siegmore certainly existed. And how much damage the demon king has caused to the world.

I don't remember, but she's on the good side. Besides, while traveling together, we listened to Zich.

For her, this was a pretty serious problem. He has no memory and is unaware of the existence of his family, friends, or acquaintances. It may not exist. No, there is even a possibility that she herself is not human.

If I had to choose the ones closest to her right now, I had no choice but to choose Zich, Hans, and Snock, the people I was traveling with.

Besides, if I had to pick one of them, of course it was Zich.

Hans and Snock are Zich's servants, and they respectfully follow him.

Because of those two, there was no choice but to feel a certain distance from Layla, who talked on an equal footing with Zich and made plans.

In other words, the closest being to Laila right now was Zich. But, if that Zich turns into a Demon King... .

Layla was not as confident as she used to be to be hostile to Zich without any emotion.

To the seriousness of Layla, Zich also gave a serious answer.

“To be honest, I have no desire to change, but I have no desire not to change.”

Maybe it's a really creepy word.

"But it does not change until now and  haeteotji?"

“To be precise, doing what I wanted to do was just a natural result.”

Although he changed it 'a little' in his own way, the result of doing good deeds was clearly the result of moving away from the demon lord of power.

'Putting it all aside, it's just the result of being recognized as an honorary knight of Carwiman.'

Even thinking about it now, it was absurd.

“Then, have you changed what you want to do now? Why all of a sudden?"

“Because the reason for that is shaking.”

Lila tried to ask why. But he soon shut his mouth.

Considering Zich's personality, it would be difficult to stop him for the reason that he had already exhausted his utility.

I'm curious, but you don't need to hear it now. Even if you listen, it will be of no use.

“Then what if there is another reason?”

Zich's gaze intertwined with Layla's.

“Hans and Snock dream of becoming warriors. What do you think would happen if you turned into a demon king?”

“I will be hostile.”

“I am sure. Don't you think I'll follow you?"

“I didn’t have such a poor education. If I become the Demon King, they will surely come to defeat me. No matter how I feel.”

It was great to cut it off like that.

“How do you think I will be?”

“You will be the same. No matter how much you travel with me, you're not a bad person. Rather, it is closer to a good man.”

"right. Aren't they a reason?"

"Well… .”

It's a little awkward, but it's not to the point that I'm not shy about doing what I want to do. Zich's answer wasn't very good for Layla.

But Lila did not give up.

“Then for a temporary reason?”

“A temporary reason?”

"okay. I'm not saying you shouldn't live your life the way you want because of our relationship. But for a while, okay?”

“After that?”

“I’ll look for it now.”

said Leila firmly. Zich stared at her face. Are you trying to express your will? A very serious face turned to Zich.

Jack laughed. like it's a lot of fun.

"great."

He said.

“Anyway, Hans and Snock’s education hasn’t ended. Because living a good life wasn't that bad either. Do what you say.”

Layla's face brightened.

“Can I just live like I used to? Don't tell me to live a better life than this. No matter how much I fulfill your conditions, there is a limit.”

"of course. On the contrary, if you really live like a good person, I think I will be terrified. It's a request, so please don't live like that. Because now is the right time.”

“You know me well.”

Jack giggled. That smile was that of the usual Zich. It was not of the cruel and selfish demon king in her knowledge.

Layla was relieved. It'll be fine for a while now that Zich said that.

'But I can't completely relax my mind.'

This is a temporary measure anyway. You need to find a reason that suits Zich's taste as soon as possible. And even in a temporary period, you can not let go of tension.

A verbal promise. If Zich says he doesn't like it, that's it.

'I wouldn't do it for no reason.'

But that means that if you have a good reason, you can ignore the promise.

'Still, I can't make him become the Demon King.'

Layla was determined.

“Okay, let’s go back when we’re done talking. No matter how many bastards are gathered in Mentis, it's not a good thing to move away from the camp during a war. There are things to think about.”

“What do you think?”

“You wouldn’t like me just killing people in war.”

This time, as in the time of the Demon King, he was trying to enjoy war purely by entrusting all operations and tactics to the commanding team.

“It is.”

“Then we must find a way to end this war quickly. Because that’s a good thing.”

"right!"

Layla happily replied. But I couldn't help but smile bitterly at Zich's next words.

“There is a room where I can pursue my hobbies.

There should also be a law Hey, good work is hard.”

* * *

Renu, the king of the Iron Clan, was in the basement of the castle.

A wide open basement door. Beyond that, I could see a tree that seemed to be on fire. But the tree is not on fire.

Surprisingly, the fire itself wrapped around the tree was part of the tree.

Possessing the power of mighty fire

tree. It was a tree with an unbelievable combination, but that was the power of the ancient Empire, Cloone, that was sealed under the castle.

The space beyond the door was dug deep enough for a large tree to fit in.

As soon as you enter the door, you will see a staircase that stretches very long to the ground where the trees are taking root.

Dozens of elves stood under the tree. They all have tiny wrinkles and bleached hair.

Considering the characteristics of elves who do not age well, they were elves who had lived for a long time, with little to no death left.

They were the elders who led the Iron Clan's past. Death is near, but not so far as to die within a few years.

Although his physical ability was a little lower, his magical ability was very high due to the knowledge and wisdom he had accumulated in the past.

Renu had really wrapped them up and hid them. It was because they were the beings who would perform rituals to make the power of Cloone available to them.

Unbeknownst to others, only the elders had to be kept.

“Wow!”

Renu looked at the ceremony and groaned.

My whole body hurt. He suffered massive burns and was wrapped in bandages all over his body.

Through the bandage, I could see a glimpse of the skin with terrible burns.

No matter how much potions were poured, the pain just subsided, and the skin did not return. And the pain that came suddenly like this was like hell to him.

But the more the pain mothed him, the more his ambitions grew. It was no longer an ambition, but an obsession.

In order to vomit the pain and anger that burned his body to the wide world, he looked at the tree of fire that had poured out the flames that had burned him, with his eyes blazing more than ever.

(Continued on next page)

No. 211 screen

Green and black magic power scattered around the tree. It was a reaction of consciousness.

The magical energy emitted by the elders of the Iron Clan rotates the tree and gently sweeps away the flames.

Perhaps because of the influence, the fire of the trees also flew back and forth along with the magic power.

In an instant, there was a shaking of the magical power of the trees that covered the castle. Renu wrinkled his face badly.

'Another intruder.'

Not long ago, an attempt was made to infiltrate the castle just after the battle where his enemies fled like a tailed dog.

'It must have been him!'

Renu wiped his face. You can feel the bandage. Behind it is hideous hideous skin.

Damn man who made himself like this.

'I should have caught it!'

I had to catch him and make his pain the same, no, ten times, twenty times more.

Burn and heal the whole body, then burn and heal the whole body again.

It seemed that at least a part of the core would have to subside after undergoing such torture for at least several decades.

However, the old record of hiding inside the castle did not go anywhere, so he really ran away like a rat.

'I'd rather lure you deep into the castle!'

So it should have been surrounded by a large number of troops. But at that time, it was not long after he suffered an injury.

They just rolled their eyes and told the soldiers to catch him. As a result, he eventually lost the person.

'Don't miss it this time!'

he turned around and moved towards the ground. I've already ordered the soldiers to leave them alone until they enter the castle to some extent if they try to infiltrate.

However, when a soldier approached and reported the report, it was a little different from what he expected.

"•••what?"

“You don’t look like the person you used to be!”

“It’s not him. So what kind of guy do you mean?”

"that is… I do not know."

“… You're not going to play with me right now."

“I, absolutely not.”

The soldier did not have the insane courage to play a prank with Renu, who had suffered terrible burns all over his body and had yet become more cruel. So, I quickly brought out an explanation of the intruder.

“He appeared as soon as he entered the castle. And I found the charge. I'm willing to sign a new contract, so I asked you to call my Highness."

"•••contract?"

"Yes! I said to my majesty that you would know! Seeing them say such things openly in the castle, it seems that they are not ordinary intruders, so I came to tell you this.”

Saying that, the soldier bowed his head. His face was drenched with sweat.

Please, I desperately hoped that my choice of reporting the intruder was not wrong.

Did anyone ever say something like that to you? Renu thought for a moment. But the thought did not last long. There were those that immediately came to mind.

“What does the intruder look like?”

“I didn’t see the appearance. The whole body is covered with a black robe.

It was them too.

“Bring it.”

"Yes!"

The soldier gave a strong answer without questioning and left Renu. His steps were very light as he was able to leave the king's side with his own life.

Renu stood in the middle of the basement and waited patiently. Shortly thereafter, a man came down, surrounded by several soldiers.

An unidentified existence with deep robes. The soldiers were exuding a sense of tension as if he was about to explode because he was very suspicious.

The robed man and the soldiers stood in front of Renu.

“You guys back off.”

The soldiers politely bowed to Renu and left the basement.

“I didn’t know you would come back to me.”

Renu opened his mouth. The one wearing the robe looked around.

“Do you need an  escort ?”

he said in a harsh voice. Perhaps there was something wrong with his neck, and the voice of the person wearing the robe was very hoarse.

After the soldier who had just left, there were no soldiers in the basement. Killing Renu seemed possible at any moment. But Renu was calm.

“At least no one here can kill me now.”

“That’s great confidence. Maybe it’s because of that power?”

The gaze of the one wearing the robe turned to the tree of fire beyond the underground door.

“If in doubt, try it.”

“No specification. I am not here to oppose you.”

"is it? Okay, so what are you here for?”

“For cooperation.”

"haha!"

Renu laughed briefly and lightly. But that alone was enough to convey his twisted ridicule.

“Cooperation? Why should I? Don't you remember that I killed your comrades because I no longer need your cooperation? No, not long ago, your colleague also made a ridiculous offer to obey you. Didn't I say that betrayal is never tolerated? Isn't your organization just that?"

“You are misunderstanding something. Renuant Dras.”

The voice of the person wearing the robe lowered for an instant.

“It has already been decided to trample you. In the near future, we will strike you on the neck and stain the earth with the blood of your clan.”

Renu stares sharply at the robed man. His words were very offensive to Renu.

“But that is for the future. We can also cooperate with the enemy if necessary.”

“What do we lack?”

“Allied forces outside Mentis. Would it be very offensive to you?”

“What were you talking about?”

Renu growled.

“Hey, you wretched delusional bastard. Do you think we'll be beaten by those idiots?"

Renu raised both hands.

“Yeah, I admit it. The overall power is what we obviously run. But is it? Time is on our side, and the island condition is very advantageous to defend. Besides, we have a way to make up for the lack of electricity. Why do we have to accept your requests for cooperation? Yes? Please tell me.” visor!

Renu took out the sword he was wearing and aimed it at the neck of the person wearing the robe. Yegi from a well-forged sword tore his robe slightly.

“If there is no reason to convince you, you will die here too.”

The man wearing the robe was silent for a moment.

“••• QUICK FUCK!”

But after a while, laughter began to flow from within the robe.

“If you are so confident, you should blow my neck right away.”

“Oh, I know how you feel. You must think there is a reason why we are reconnecting like this, having already broken cooperation and even killed our comrades. You're right. We have a reason, and we are ready to offer you benefits for our own benefit. But it is, Renuent Dras.”

The one who wore the robe spoke with an attitude of seeing the poor.

“If you have that kind of confidence, you can blow the neck of a guy like me right away and keep going your way. But even when I say things that are full of pretentiousness, I can't really do it. Your bowl has appeared. Are you afraid of having absolute power in your hands? It's even pitiful, King of the Iron Clan."

Whoops!

Renu's sword went even deeper into the neck of the robed one.

“It looks like I want to die right now!” “But you are not killing.” Silence fell for a moment in the confrontation between the two.

“Well, good.”

It was the one wearing the robe who broke the silence.

“Your tone was a bit harsh. In any case, we would like to partner with you for a while. Lend us our troops in this war.”

“I would have said it wasn’t necessary.”

“Even if the tears of the lake have returned to the clan of the lake?”

In an instant, the sword Renu was holding shook.

"•••what?"

“Isn’t that one of the reasons why you betrayed us and made your clan only dream in vain? The disappearance of tears in the lake. Of course it can't be just that. Because you didn't wake up right after the tears of the lake disappeared. No, was that period a preparation period? Well, it doesn't matter if you check it out now. Anyway, the tears of the lake are back.”

"Nonsense! It must have been said that humans stole it and left this forest!”

“They said that the princess of the lake clan came to visit.”

“Leona?”

I had heard that she ran away to find the tears of the lake.

But he decided that he would come back after failure, or even if he succeeded, only after all his plans were successful.

'But you came back so quickly?'

“What would you do?”

said the one who wore the robe.

“If you use the tears of the lake, won’t the guys who say that they supplement your weak army use it properly?”

Renu stared at him as if to eat him.

“•••What do you want?”

"does not exist."

"gibberish."

“It sounds like bullshit, but it really isn’t. Strictly speaking, there is nothing you can do about it. During the war, we will find out on our own.”

“Tell me!”

“Don’t refuse.”

“Then no cooperation!”

“Then cut your throat. If I do not return within today, the negotiations will automatically break down.”

Renu clenched his sword. His arms trembled and his sword shook. I could feel his overflowing anger.

But in the end, Renu lowered his sword.

“Tell me your plan.”

“Welcome. Temporary ally.”

Renu made a harsh impression on the gentle voice coming from inside the robe.

A few days have passed since the first battle. The Allied Forces took the damage and set out to attack once again. The attack method was the same as before.

But one thing was different.

jerk

A single female elf stood on the shore of the lake. The woman holding the blue jewel was Romanne, a shaman of the lake clan.

She looked at the mentis over the lake with tense eyes.

Allied forces passed by her. I set my boat on the shore of the lake and started moving slowly.

It was the beginning of the second battle.


The Iron Clan was glaring at the Allied Forces from the lake shore as before. However, the number was lower than before.

It was also due to the damage suffered in the last battle, but more than that, it was the effect of having reserve units all over the island. In addition, it was to prevent being attacked from the rear because of the tunnel.

However, the small number was not a threat to the Iron Clan.

Hwareuk! Hwareuk! Hwareuk!

Fireballs moving towards the lakeside began to gather. Its flaming arms seemed like it would make a huge fire hole in the enemy's body, and its faceless head seemed to spit fire at any moment.

Seeing this, the Allied Forces approaching by boat swallowed their saliva. But their boat did not stop.

Tuoung!

an arrow was shot Like last time, the first attack was a bow. Arrows fell like rain on each other.

But the fireballs were waiting quietly. It didn't seem like it was out of reach yet.

Whoops!

Next was magic. Balls of fire came and went at each other, the wind blew, and balls of water were shot at each other. But even then, the fireball was still.

The moment the two camps approached a little closer.

Whoops!

The fireballs moved. Flames from their heads rushed towards the ships.

But the fireballs were not the only ones waiting for that moment.

The tears of the lake that Romanne was holding burst into clear tears.

(Continued on next page)


No. 212 screen

The magic of the lake's tears spreads everywhere. There is also the geographical advantage of being a large lake, so the magic of the lake's tears moved more vigorously.

The magic that was gently passing over the surface of the lake arrived at the place where the Allied Forces on the boat were.

Even the Allied Forces, who were fighting fiercely, felt the magic.

I was not surprised because it had already been reported. Some of them were just wiping their skin strangely even in the midst of battle.

But that's not enough to show your curiosity. The Allied Forces, who were preparing for magic, changed the magic.

Up until now, she has fused several attributes with her fellow mates, but from now on, she can only use one magic.

It was just water magic.

Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

A huge stream of water flies towards Mentis. The water stream, thick enough to swallow two or three people whole, had even the power of rotation and hit the shore of the lake.

“Aww!”

“Aww!”

The elves of the Iron Clan collapse with a suffocation. A stream of water pierced through the thin cover.

The iron clan had no choice but to panic as the magic that was far more powerful than the magic of the past flew incessantly.

Whoops! Whoops!

The fireballs hit by the water also exploded.

“Don't back down! Keep your seat!”

Kendis, who was behind him, took a step forward and shouted loudly.

“They wrote the tears of the lake! No embarrassment! wait a moment!"

Lake Tears greatly increases the power of water-based magic within influence.

At first glance, it seems that the Allies have a great advantage, but there was a reason why the Allied Forces did not mobilize the tears of the lake from the beginning.

hooo

The magic of the lake's tears sweeps through the surroundings. I could feel the magic of water from my skin.

The problem was that those who felt the magic were the elves of the Iron Clan.

“Shoot!”

At Kendis's orders, the Iron Clan used magic. They chose the same water magic as the Allied Forces.

And the tears of the lake even strengthened their magic.

Whoops!

A large stream of water hits the surface of the lake. The ships of the Allied Forces nearby shook violently.

An arrow shot by the Iron Clan aimed at that gap and attacked the Allied Forces. The elves who were hit by the arrows fell into the lake screaming loudly.

Quajiic!

There were also cases where the whole ship was disassembled by magic.

The appearance of the other magics did not disappear completely, but those magics were used by elves who could not use water magic.

And even that, they were all magic with excellent compatibility with water magic.

By then, the magic of the lake's tears was no longer beneficial to the Allies. In a way, it was like a handshake of the Allied Forces that spread the magic of the lake's tears.

But it wasn't meaningless.

Hwareuk!

The size of the fireballs filling the gaps between the camps of the Iron Clan rapidly decreased.

Compared to an adult male, one head was reduced from a large size to almost half or the size of an adult male's waist. Even the flames burning all over his body were lifeless.

The magic of the lake's tears began to suppress the fireballs.

After confirming the appearance, the Allied Forces

I started rowing with all my heart.

* * *

“Uh - huh !”

Breathe out from the inside out. Romanne felt the magic of the tears of the lake she was holding and looked at the Mentis in the distance.

"Thanks for your efforts."

said Laila, who was next to Romanne. Romanne smiled.

“It’s hard work. Layla did more of the hard work.”

“I was only helping Romane to the end.”

It was she who assisted with magical power by the side when Romanne woke up the tears of the lake. But Romanne firmly shook her head.

“I couldn't do this by myself. The magic of the lake's tears also spread farther than I expected.”

What she said was true. If Romane had dealt with the tears of the lake alone, its influence would have barely covered the end of the Mentis.

However, the moment he received Layla's help, his influence grew even greater, and now the influence of the Lake's Tears covered half of the Mentis.

'Certainly a great wizard.'

Humans, even at such a young age, have such magical powers and magical powers.

Even Romanne, who had been living for quite a while, had the ability to be astonished.

'Besides, it doesn't seem like all of my talents have fully bloomed even now.'

The person named Zich who saved him was also a great human being, but it seemed that Laila would not fall for it.

However, along with admiration for her, Romanne also harbored some doubts.

'The lake's tears responded so well to her magic.'

It was Romanne herself who asked her, an excellent wizard, to help her. But that doesn't mean we're expecting huge efficiencies. What was expected of her was literally an assistant.

However, the results were beyond expectations.

The compatibility of Layla and Lake's tears was so well matched, and the result was shown as the influence of Lake's tears, which now covers half of Mentis beyond the lake.

'Is it just a coincidence?'

You might as well dismiss it like that. However, from the moment the shaman of the lake clan is recognized as a shaman, he begins training to assimilate with the magic of the lake's tears.

But Layla, who has never received such training, shows such compatibility with Tears of the Lake.

'Honestly, I'm a little disappointed.'

I also felt that my life as a shaman was denied.

“Why? Do you have anything else to do?”

When he came to his senses, he was staring at Laila. Romanne quickly shook her head.

“No, no. For a moment, I had a different thought. As I get older, I feel more and more mischievous.”

It was very strange to say something like that from Romane, who still maintains her vivid 20s appearance in human terms .

Leila didn't reply, just an awkward smile.

Romanne looked at Mentis.

“For now, the plan is going smoothly.”

The Allied Forces, who were slowly approaching Mentis, were disembarking from the ship. Although the Iron Clan desperately resisted, the number of the Allied Forces was far greater.

In addition, the fireballs, which were the trump cards of the Iron Clan, could not use their power properly due to the tears of the lake, so the number of allied forces landing in Mentis gradually increased.

"Iknow, right. From now on, Zeeg will do well.”

“Huhu, you trust your colleague very much.”

"sure."

Lila nodded her head firmly. Although they are of different races, seeing people of a young age are connected with firm trust brings a happy smile.

“That guy, I can’t lose to anyone as much as tormenting people.”

The reason for trust was a little different from what Romane expected.

♦ * *

From the highest spire of the castle, Renu was looking at the battlefield. His clan is being pushed little by little by the shore of the lake. He grinded it gently.

“Damn Lake Tears!”

Renu smashed the spire's handrail.

His eyes were set on the shores of the lake where the Allied camp was, leaving the fierce battle.

was there A shaman of the lake clan with the tears of the lake.

“So what did I say? The tears of the lake are back.”

An unpleasant sound is heard from within the darkness created by the spire's roof.

A voice that is annoying to hear. Renu groaned and looked back.

The owner of the voice took a step out of the darkness.

He was wearing a robe.

Naturally, he stood next to Renu and once again made that unpleasant voice.

“Are you completely convinced now?”

“… ok!”

Renu made a sick sound.

First of all, they are two people who are cooperating, but there is not much trust in each other.

Because of this, Renu was thinking about the possibility that the person wearing the robe was lying.

However, seeing the tears and the power of the lake that Romanne was holding, Renu had no choice but to admit that the words of the person wearing the robe were not lies.

“Now what?”

“When will your cheerleaders show up!”

Renu said harshly. But the one wearing the robe was not agitated.

“Now if you want. But it would be good to think carefully about when to use it. Even my men are not enough to overwhelm the elf coalition.”

The help the robed man decided to give Renu was his strength.

Until the ritual of manipulating the power of the Fire Tree was over, Renu was able to summon the forces of the robed men as allies.

“If I had landed my troops on Mentis and had them block it with your clan, even if the opponent had tears in the lake, it would have been easier to block it from the time of landing. After all, it's no fun to argue about things that have already happened. When you stopped my troops from landing the Mentis

It’s something that hasn’t happened since then.”

It was a mockery of Renu who did not believe in himself and did not allow his troops to set foot on the Mentis.

Renu knew it too, but since it was an undeniable fact, he couldn't respond.

Whoops!

Meanwhile, a pile of dirt rose high in the center of the mentis.

“That tunnel.”

Only the one wearing the robe spoke lowly, and Renu stared at the hole that was clearly connected to the tunnel with bloodshot eyes.

“Your clan is retreating.”

As the person wearing the robe said, Kendis was battling the troops. That had already been promised.

When the battle conditions became unfavorable in the situation where the power of the fireballs and what the iron clan called flame troopers were weakened by the tears of the lake, the iron clan was supposed to withdraw outside the influence of the tears of the lake.

'But the sphere of influence of the lake's tears is too great. What the hell happened?' Renu, unaware of Laila's existence, had no choice but to question. But now is not the time to figure out the cause.

“•••Your troops are now hiding in the woods outside the lake, right?”

"of course. The Allied forces are ready at any time. Waiting only the signal and  not. "

Renu looked at where the robed man was pointing. It was hidden by the thick forest, so he couldn't see the troops, but it was reassuring to know that he had the troops he could mobilize in the back of the enemy.

"for a moment."

The robed man placed his hand on the spire's railing and leaned forward a little.

“The shaman is moving.”

"what?"

Renu immediately looked away. As the one wearing the robe said, the shaman was carefully loading the boat.

“It looks like the shaman is trying to come to Mentis himself.”

“Perhaps he intends to place the Mentis itself within the sphere of influence of Tears of the Lake.”

Renu grinded his teeth.

The shaman's body may be in danger, but if Mentis is placed within the sphere of influence of the tears of the lake, the Iron Clan will inevitably be at a disadvantage.

“What if the sphere of influence of the lake’s tears reaches this far?”

“Don’t worry. No matter how great the tears of the lake are, they cannot exert their influence even around this castle.”

"That means that if not around this castle, it falls within the sphere of the lake's tears."

Renu responded with silence.

“What are you going to do? Are you going to make white flags from now on?”

"gibberish!"

Renu dismissed the man wearing the robe.

“Well, yes. It was just a joke. Don't take it too seriously. I'd rather be fine Let’s change our thinking like this.”

“•••How do you mean?”

“The tears of the shaman and the lake came to the mentis. In other words, if you change your mind, now is a great opportunity to secure the shaman and the tears of the lake.”

(Continued on next page)

Renu looked down at the lake again at the words of the man in the robe.

A boat carrying Romanne floated on the lake and was heading to Mentis. And by that much, the area of ​​tears in the lake eroded Mentis even more.

“There is nothing better than that, if only in your words. But what are you going to do?” “After the shaman enters Mentis, I attack the men’s camp with my own forces. Of course, it should be done after the shaman has been brought into the mentis to some extent. If you're going to put all the Mentis within the sphere of influence of the Lake's Tears, she'll have to come near the center of Mentis. Then, no matter how much the Allied Forces, they will inevitably fall into chaos. It takes advantage of that gap.”

Renu looked at the forces of the Allied Forces that were now in Mentis. After the resistance had dissipated, the Allies laid down their forces really easily.

The number of troops that had already landed was comparable to that of his own clan.

It seems that the person wearing the robe saw the same thing as Renu.

“The army is the same. In a little while, there will be more guys. Even if you succeed, your clan will suffer a lot of damage. Still, if you can secure the tears of the lake, it will be a success.”

“But the chances of failure are high.”

“That would be unavoidable. Because the scale of power is different.”

The man in the robe who spoke so coldly was silent for a moment, then opened his mouth again.

“Do you have any hidden troops?”

"what?"

“It’s okay if you don’t have an army. Did you guys say that he was a flame trooper? I like that special power. I asked if there was any more power I could mobilize now.”

Renu didn't answer for a moment.

“There is.”

“It’s a really important time… .”

“You mean it doesn’t matter now?” Renu shut his mouth.

“You are misunderstanding something, the King of the Iron Clan.”

The voice of the one wearing the robe became even lower. He also seemed a little angry.

The fact that the person who always spoke Renu's full name when calling him, now calls his post, also encouraged that thought.

“Even if we weren’t there in the first place, you were able to defend enough with your own strength. It's made impossible because the Allies brought Tears of the Lake. However, now has come a golden opportunity to seize the tears of the lake, the only force that is oppressing you now. Then I ask you one more time, the King of the Iron Clan.” “Do you think now is not the time to use that power?”

"•••I get it."

Renu gave a command to a soldier standing by. The soldier hurriedly jumped down.

“Is it a riot?”

The man in the robe who heard Renu's command from the side asked.

"okay. By overloading the Fire Tree during rituals, you can temporarily manipulate the Fire Tree's power as you wish. At that moment, even the tears of the lake will not be able to stop the Flame Troopers.”

“Strengthen the flame troopers. How strong are you?”

“Maybe I'll be strong until I'm not affected by the tears of the lake. If it wasn't for the tears of the lake, I'd be stronger than that."

Renu said bitterly.

“Are there any side effects of course?”

“The completion of consciousness is pushed back.”

That's why Renu didn't want to use this method as much as possible. But for now, it was right to follow the words of the one wearing the robe. If they can only claim the tears of the lake, their victory is solidified.

"Right."

The man in the robe pulled something out of his bosom. it was a flute He put the flute in his mouth and blew hard.

Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!

The sound of the flute repeating short and long cuts and continuations was definitely a signal. The loud, high-pitched sound of the flute reached over the lake and into the forest.

Renu looked at the man in the robe.

“What are you doing?”

Renu's voice stood out at the suspicious behavior of the Provisional Alliance.

“Can’t you see? Of course, it is sending a signal.”

“What signal?”

“A signal to go to the designated coordinates and move because the battle will start soon.”

The man in the robe replied calmly and put the flute back into his bosom. And he said unpleasantly to Renu, who was staring at him.

“No matter how long it takes, we will be fighting for our lives, but if you are going to react sensitively to each one like this, what are you holding hands for? Again, it was you who prevented my men from landing on Mentis. If they had been in Mentis, there would have been no need for such troublesome signals. After all, are you now suspicious of even sending a signal to my subordinates? So, how am I supposed to move my troops? Should I even shout?”

Renu had nothing to say.

“… The signal would be heard by the Allied forces too? What will you do if your subordinates are found out?”

It was such a pitiful excuse to say only a few words. Of course, the one wearing the robe didn't even snort.

“Anyone who hears the signal from the castle will understand it as an order you gave to your clan. Stop talking nonsense.”

"•••I get it."

In the end, Renu had no choice but to admit his mistake.

that time. Allied camps.

The signal from the robed man was, of course, audible to them as well.

“It’s a signal.”

The king of the Plains clan, who sat at the command post as the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces, shone.

“Interpret.”

"Yes!"

A subordinate elf standing next to him heard the signal and started writing something on the paper. The signal continued, and the elf's hand movements continued.

The signal was cut off. The elf took the paper and approached the king of the plains clan.

“What did you send?”

“The number of the opponent’s trump card. Clawone's power runaway. For a short period of time, the fireballs will find their way within the sphere of Lake Tear.”

“Cluckle!”

The king of the plains clan laughed cheerfully. The other elves next door were the same.

“Did you say Zich? The daughter of the king of the clan of the lake has brought a really great one.”

“Ability, courage, intellect, etc. are not missing.”

“Honestly, I thought he was crazy when he said he would go next to the King of the Iron Clan to gather information and control the war situation.”

“Is that so? From the beginning, I thought he was a very funny and great guy.”

And the king of the plains clan burst into laughter again.

Then a soldier ran to them.

“I will report you. The shaman has arrived at Mentis.”

"Oh yeah? Then we will continue to transport troops.”

“But will I be deceived?'

“What are you worried about though?”

The king of the mountain clan smiled at the side of the castle that was hidden by the bushes.

“The person next to the king of the great Iron Clan should take care of it.” Eventually, the shaman landed on Mentis. His frown was frowned upon, but Renu forced him to open it again.

As the one wearing the robe said, I decided to think of the shaman and the tears of the lake as a great opportunity to seize it.

The influence of the lake's tears has already eaten up 2/3 of the mentees . To that extent, the defense line of the Iron Clan had also retreated.

“That… .”

Renu's eyes, as he was contemplating when to time the attack, saw something different. The one in the robe was also interested.

“Is it armor?”

“It’s all golems.”

Renu grinded it gently. It reminded me of the bitter memory of being swung by them and taking all the hostages.

“Ah, those who insulted you.”

When the man in the robe said that, he got even hotter.

“They say the performance is not very good. How about in reality?”

“Most of them are people who fill in numbers from behind. They don't die as well as golems, but they don't perform well either."

“How about comparing it to your soldiers?”

“It's not even worth comparing. One soldier will be able to take down two generations without difficulty.”

“•••Are you deceived by those guys?”

“There were some very good performers. It was those guys who fought directly. We were completely deceived by that scheme.”

As he spoke, Renu clenched his fists. The person wearing the robe once again looked towards the armored side.

“But there are quite a lot of armor. According to what you said, it seems that you have mobilized all the people who only filled in numbers.”

The feast of armor shining in the sunlight neatly arranged on the shore of the lake was creating a spectacle in itself. They boarded the boat one by one and headed for Mentis.

“All those who come over now are golems. The elves don't seem to come over anymore."

Even from the hole in the center of the mentis, armor was now coming out instead of an elf.

“Why a useless golem… .” What the hell is your plan? It was when Renu was trying to guess what the Union Army was thinking.

“Isn’t it for the shaman’s escort?”

The one in the robe said indifferently.

“For escort? What kind of escorts are these poor bastards doing?”

"is it? I think it's a pretty good way. After all, the shaman will not come directly to the battlefield. will be in the back Then the natural threats will be arrows and magic. But if those guys protect it, the risk will drop. No matter how poor the performance of the golem, it will have enough performance to block it with its body.”

"•••Come to think of it."

The number of armor landing as Mentis was quite large. He must have mobilized all the golems that were not broken in the last battle.

'If that level of golems block the shaman's surroundings and block the attack with their body, the shaman's safety will be greatly protected.'

As well as by history, but a shield to use  will have to.

'And the force that should be used as a shaman's escort might be turned into an attack.'

Apparently, the person wearing the robe was right.

“The shaman is moving.”

At the words of the person wearing the robe, Renu looked through the entire chapter. As if she had mobilized enough armor, the shaman was moving with her armor literally wrapped around her.

“I think I am right. The golems don’t stay away from the shaman.”

"Right. You really look like an escort. But the escort is a little overrated. How much do you plan to spend?”

Although the shaman was moving, the ships continued to carry the golem.

“Well, that must be how important the shaman is.”

Saying that, the man in the robe turned to Renu.

“How about our attack after all those golems have landed?”

“Is it necessary?”

Renu seemed to want to attack right away.

“Think about it. The closer the shaman comes to the depths of the mentis, the higher the probability of stealing the shaman and the lake's tears. If the Allied Forces continue to send reinforcements, it wouldn't hurt to attack quickly, but the only thing they're sending is the cans that are useless as shields. If the only support to be put in is the golem, it would be better to draw the shaman even deeper.”

“Well, that’s right.”

“Remember our purpose, Renuent Dras. The goal we need to succeed now is not to increase the damage of the Allied Forces or reduce our damage. The shaman and securing the tears of the lake, those two.”

“… good. Do what you think.”

Eventually Renu allowed the armor to continue to enter the Mentis. In order to attract the shaman to the depths of the mentis.

(Continued on next page)

No. 214 screen

Most of the armor in the Iron Clan, Renu's Yongin, landed on Mentis.

Meanwhile, Romane continued to move to the heart of Mentis. Already, the influence of Lake's Tears covered most of the Mentis.

The only areas unaffected were around the castle and on the shore of the lake opposite where the Allies had landed.

“Sometimes soon.”

The man in the robe looked at Renu.

“How are the troops deployed?”

“It’s all over.”

"okay. Then shall we begin?”

The man in the robe took out his flute again and blew it.

“The attack will start after a while. Your clan should also start attacking accordingly.”

“I do.”

Renu gave orders to his subordinates again. After the men ran down the tower, the movement of the Iron Clan became busier.

Renu and the man in the robe looked down at Mentis quietly.

After a while.

“It has begun.”

As the man in the robe said, the camp of the Allied Forces on the other side of the lake became bustling.

Although it was the main base of the Allied Forces, which was obscured by the thick waters, it was clear that something had happened.

The movement to start a new ship to pass to Mentis stopped.

“It is now. Renuant Dras.”

"good!"

Renu gave the signal. A fire erupted from below the castle. Explosive magical power spreads. The magic of the tears of the lake that covered Mentis shook.

whoops.

The flame troopers, who had become smaller and weaker in the influence of the lake's tears, began to regain their strength.

Its size returned to its original state, and the faint pulsing of the flame exploded again like an active volcano. It looked like it would burn everything around it at any moment.

“Attack!”

Candice's loud shout echoed through Renu and the robed man at the spire.

The troops of the Iron Clan, who had only retreated so far, ran out with a loud shout.

quaang

The two groups collided. At first, the two groups fought almost equally, but little by little the Iron Clan began to dominate.

The number of pure troops was slightly higher on the Allied side, but when the flame troopers who regained their power joined, the number was reversed.

"great!"

Renu clenched his fists. The war went as expected.

Because of the disturbance that occurred behind the main base, the Allied Forces could no longer send troops to Mentis. And the Allied Forces in Mentis were struggling with the flame troopers' performance.

“Keep pushing! It’s just to secure the tears of the shaman and the lake!”

Renu said vigorously. At that time, there was a change on the side of the Allied Forces.

“The golems are moving.” As the person wearing the robe said, I could see the armor that had been attached to the shaman moving to the point where the battle took place.

Renu snorted.

“The war situation is unfavorable, so even those guys should be mobilized. But it's useless. Because the performance of the golem is obvious.”

On the contrary, it will be easier to kill the shaman as the shaman's escort will decrease.

The golems approaching the battle point rushed at the Iron Clan and the Flame Troopers. Renu smiled and watched the scene.

Whoops! Whoops!

“Great!”

“Aww!”

However, as the flame troopers were destroyed by the golems and the iron clan died, his ridicule disappeared without a trace.

"what!"

Hurriedly, Renu put his hand on the railing of the spire and looked at him. Even those wearing robes seemed to have  noticed the high performance of the  armor .

“Are those good golems?

But like you said, I don't think it's a minority."

As he said, the golems that collide with the Iron Clan were all showing off their decent skills.

“What happened?”

A person wearing a robe asks coldly. But Renu couldn't answer. The golems he saw and received could never produce such a performance.

However, his doubts were soon resolved.

The golems began to take off their armor as if it was frustrating. When Renu found out his identity, he couldn't help but be terrified.

Those who thought they were golems were all elves.

“Me, me, those guys… .”

“This is true.”

Unlike Renu, who couldn't keep his mouth shut, those wearing robes spit coldly.

“I was deceived.”

“Oh, I was deceived… .”

“Isn’t it obvious, Renuent de Lass. Knowing that we would look down on golems, the Allies mimicked golems after they put on their armor. He predicted that we wouldn't be strong enough to prevent the landing of the golem, which was not very powerful."

“  Well then… !”

“All those we thought were golems should be regarded as allied forces disguised as golems.”

As the person wearing the robe said, I saw elves throwing their armor off here and there in the Mentis. Seeing this, the soldiers of the Iron Clan were greatly perplexed.

“In other words, the opposing forces are much larger than we thought. Maybe even a resurrected flame trooper can’t stop it.” Renu hurriedly looked at the situation. The sudden increase in the enemy's forces was also bewildering, so the soldiers of the Iron Clan seemed to be being pushed back by the Allied Forces.

“Ah, no matter how much the enemy’s army increases, there are flame troopers… !”

"I think it's because of the lake's tears again this time."

"what'?"

“No matter how much a flame trooper finds his power, it doesn’t change that he is weak to water magic. But the tears of the lake amplify the magical power of water.”

Renu's eyes lit up with blood as he saw three flame troopers explode at the same time in a huge stream of water shot by the Allied Forces.

“It would have been meaningless if we had more troops as planned, but now the number of allied forces is larger.”

And the one in the robe met Renu and sighed for the first time.

“You played perfectly.”

“… This, this food… !”

Suddenly, Renu rushed at the robed man. His hand tried to grab the man in the robe by the collar, but the man in the robe easily escaped his grasp.

“What are you doing?”

“It’s because of you! If you hadn't told me to land those armors, this wouldn't have happened!"

“What did you say?”

The man in the robe laughed cynically.

“Don't be silly, Renuant de Lass. You were the one who informed me that the armor was just a golem. It was a bonus that the modifiers that the performance was poor, the ones who filled only the head count were a bonus. Besides, did I unilaterally give orders? You should have the authority to command the Iron Clan, which is now fighting in Mentis.”

Renu exhaled heavily. He sent a look of resentment towards the person wearing the robe, but the words of the person wearing the robe were never wrong.

“Then command your men! Help us now!”

“I really want to, but my men are engaged in a battle with the Allied Forces headquarters. I don't know again. If someone in Mentis had allowed my men to land, they might have been blocking the Allied Forces with your men by now.”

Sparks flew between the robed man and Renu.

Anyone can see it's an instantaneous situation. A few soldiers of the Iron Clan, who were waiting in the back, sneakily put their hands on their weapons.

However, the feared armed conflict did not occur.

Renu turned his back and began to descend down the spire.

“Where are you going?”

“You don’t know!”

Renu shouted harshly. However, the one wearing the robe ignored his opinion and followed Renu's back.

“It seems like you keep forgetting it, but you and I are allies. Only when you win can I get what I need. If you think you're going to do something, just tell me. Only then can I move for your victory.”

Renu, who was silently staring at the man in the robe, turned his head. Then he started descending from the spire again. But that didn't stop the robed person from following. Rather, he stopped the soldiers who were trying to stop him.

'I have to borrow this guy's hand as much as this is the case.'

It wasn't really my intention, but the situation was too bad to shake off the hand of the person wearing the robe now.

“I’m going underground.”

Renu opened his mouth.

"underground? Where is the fire tree?”

"okay. I plan to test the elders to see if they can increase the output there.”

"Right. If the flame trooper's performance goes up, this situation can be overcome. But is that possible?”

“I’ll have to squeeze my magic power somehow.”

There Renu looked at the man in the robe.

“I must mobilize your magic power as well.”

“Somehow, it seemed to guide me to a place where there was a tree of fire that I had not been able to access until now. But good. Now is not the time to cover up the means.”

Renu and the one in the robe went down to the basement in an instant.

In the basement, the fire tree still stood majestic.

From the basement to the lower floors of the castle, flames from the fire tree were burning fiercely, but there was a passageway that could move.

The two reached the base of the fire tree. There, I could see the elders of the Iron Clan who were sweating profusely and generating magical powers.

“What are you doing, my lord?”

The highest elder of the Iron Clan, who was leading the other elders, greeted Renu politely. Sweat dripping down and pale complexion never look normal.

But Renu didn't even care about his health.

“Unleash more power from the Fire Tree.”

It was just an order.

Annoyance was young on the face of the chief elder.

“Sir, that is impossible! You are still barely controlling the power of the Fire Tree! If there is even a slight misunderstanding here, the entire area will be consumed by the power of the Fire Tree!” However, Renu did not blink an eye at his plea.

“If we lose this war, there is no future for our clan! In that case, even at the risk of self-destruction, we need to draw more power!”

“Hah… !”

“This is an order, Supreme Elder!”

The supreme elder closed his eyes tightly. Le Nougat realized that he would never be persuaded.

"•••all right."

“Don't worry too much. This ceremony will be attended by me and those over there. The success rate will increase and your burden will not increase that much.”

No matter how much Renu felt a little burdened by the clan's chief elder, he changed his tone a little softly.

“If you tell me, you can participate in the ceremony, but does the author have the magical power to participate in the ceremony?”

The Chief Elder looked suspiciously at the robed man.

It is about squeezing beyond the limits of consciousness. More than a certain amount of horsepower was essential.

“He is the commander of an unidentified organization that has helped us even if it rots. You must have enough magic.”

“If horsepower is an issue, don’t worry. At least I've never heard of anyone falling behind."

“That’s right.”

Renu tapped the Elder Elder's shoulder.

“You will help with the basic mana operation.”

"all right."

Renu, who entrusted the robe-wearing man to the Chief Elder, walked under the fire tree, feeling the gaze of the elders focused on him.

“The fate of our clan is at stake in the rituals we are doing from now on! If we succeed, we will stand tall in the world as great rulers, and if we fail, our clan will disappear into history. But I have no doubt that we will succeed! I'll be participating in the ceremony too, so be more alert than ever!”

"Yes!"

The elders answered in unison.

“Come on, unknown ally. Your place is me... .”

Renu's speech was interrupted. A look of astonishment was also etched on the faces of the other elders.

“Big billion!”

The highest elder who leads the elders of the Iron Clan. A sword protruded from his chest. And the one who held the sword was the one who wore the robe, an ally of the Iron Clan.

(Continued on next page)

No. 215 screen

Blood spews from the mouth of the Chief Elder. The pure white beard is dyed red. His eyes fluttered in embarrassment, then gradually faded away.

"Big... uh... ”

That was the last voice the Supreme Elder left on this earth.

his body sags The fact that he couldn't even fall because of the sword that pierced his chest made a more tragic scene.

“Hey, oh oh oh oh!”

One of the elders roars loudly. Others who had been engrossed in the unrealistic situation also began to move.

At the same time, he points his hand at the person wearing the robe and activates magic.

Whether it was they who received the title of elder among the Iron Clan, the magic they fired perfectly complemented each other and increased their power.

The action chosen by the person wearing the robe was simple.

It was to throw the supreme elder's corpse into magic.

Aww!

Magic exploded on the corpse of the Chief Elder. His body exploded, pouring fragments everywhere.

Even if he was tolerant of a cruel situation to a certain extent, it was a cruel sight that made his face go red.

But the one wearing the robe didn't care. Rather, whether blood and flesh were sprinkled on his robes or not, he moved towards the gap where the magic had disappeared.

“This child… !”

The elder raised his fist at the person wearing the robe who approached in an instant.

However, the elder's fists were patheticly weak because he had no weapon and had lost his physical abilities due to his age.

👌👌👌👌👌

With his fist, his body was split in two. Blood splattered at the base of the fire tree.

The one wearing the robe moved in search of the next prey. I see an elder standing next to me hurriedly backing away. His sword brutally pursued the elder.

Scratch!

A red line was engraved on the elder's neck. The line widened sharply, and finally the head and body fell apart.

“Gather up! Let's get together in one place!”

“Protect Your Majesty! Your Majesty, come this way!”

However, the experience they had accumulated so far did not go anywhere, so they placed the fire tree on their back to warn the person wearing the robe.

Meanwhile, the one wearing the robe killed three more elders. However, he also stood still to see if he could move any more hastily.

The elders were preparing a full-fledged magic, not the magic that was shot out in a hurry with a silent spear like before.

It was obviously difficult to deal with the magic of an elder-level elf, and not just one, but several.

“Hey, you fucking bastard!”

In the face of confrontation, Renu yelled at the robed man.

He chewed it and looked at his opponent. I could feel the feeling of wanting to cut his body to pieces even if I didn't see it.

Several elders, including the supreme elder, died at the hands of the one wearing the robe.

Of course, Renu had no heart to mourn their deaths. They are tools after all. Although he feels sorry for the destruction of the tool, he does not feel sad.

The problem is that it was a tool that would give him enormous power.

Moreover, it was painful to say that the ally had hit him in the head, no matter how temporary.

It's not that I trust him. Even if he hit the back of the head, Renu himself should have hit it. Wasn't Renu thinking that being hit in the back of the head was proof that he was that stupid?

This situation only proved Renu's own stupidity.

“You betrayed me! What is your purpose!”

All kinds of thoughts ran through Renu's head. Are they trying to save their lives by handing them over to the Allied Forces? Or was this the way it was supposed to be from the beginning?

“I don’t know what the plot is, but do you think everything will go your way? Neither you nor your organization will get what you want! never!"

He really put his head down and threw a curse. Betrayal in an unfavorable situation pushed Renu's hatred to the limit.

But his real fever hasn't even begun yet.

“••• Kick!”

A laugh escaped the mouth of the man in the robe, who had been silent until now, wielding only his sword.

“Kick Kick Kick!”

low-pitched laughter. Rather, it was the sound of laughter that scratched Renu's nerves more than the open laughter.

Did he not know how Renu felt like that? The robe's laughter grew louder.

"hahahahahahahaha!"

As he grabbed his stomach and chattered, he stopped laughing. and opened his mouth.

"Organization?"

A voice of laughter spreads. Renu frowned.

The voice of the person wearing the robe is as harsh as scratching iron. But the voice he heard now was not the voice he had ever heard.

An ordinary voice that is clean and not uncomfortable to listen to.

“What kind of organization are you talking about? What kind of organization are you wearing dark robes and conspiring from behind?”

"what are you saying...."

Renu had various ideas about the reason for the betrayal of the one wearing the robe, but at least what he said now was not what Renu had expected.

“Like cockroaches, they avoid people’s eyes and look for something to eat. If you think about it that way, they must have been a really good match for you.”

“You, maybe… !”

It was then that Renu began to catch up. The organization was not betrayed.

The guy who collaborated with him in the first place was not the guy of the organization.

“But you, who eats even those dirty and sultry cockroaches and acts as if you own the whole world, are like, well, something a little lower than that. How should this be compared? multiplication and so on? muckworm? It is very difficult to find something that is compared to someone like you, even in a country with a flamboyant eloquence.”

I think I've heard this voice before. Feeling the burns in the bandages hurting again, Renu stuttered more.

"you… you… !”

👌👌👌👌👌

The plain long sword held by the robed man made a difference. Many blades sprout like a tree stretches its branches.

How could you forget that type of sword? It was a grotesque sword that opened the door that had sealed off the room with this fire tree.

“You hey hey!”

Renu shouted like a scream. The one who wore the robe, Zich, took off the robe splendidly.

“Hey, nice to meet you, Renuant Dras. Is it our sphere?”

Unlike the screaming Renu and the other elders whose eyes widened in surprise, Zich said with a really refreshing smile.

“I remember seeing this room a while ago. I wanted to see you one more time, so I pretended to be someone else. Surely you will forgive me? Isn't that the comrade you fought with the Allied Forces together before?"

Zich speaks cheerfully as usual. Of course, the content was completely different from the tone of the tone.

The elders' faces turned red when they heard the ridicule. Their king was insulted.

Surprisingly, however, Renu did not show a different reaction.

I just keep my head down. But seeing his clenched fists trembled, it was clear that it wasn't because his mind was calm.

“•••Since when?”

Questions that do not understand the intent. However, Zich easily understood the intent of the question and answered it.

“The human of the organization you know will probably end up being the one you killed. Everything I met after that was me.”

“Maybe the guy who came to confirm the betrayal… !”

“I thought the gangs had something to do with you. In order to verify that, and to get information about your guy, I tried to fake you in disguise. Hey, thank you so much for giving me the information I was looking for. Oh, come to think of it, I didn’t thank you.”

Zich threw something. Renu and the elders were nervous all at once.

But it wasn't dangerous. Human money, among them, was of the lowest value.

“Buy something delicious with this and eat it later. Don't do this nasty thing in such a shady place. So you don't have friends and your personality is crooked. This is really my advice, so don’t misunderstand it.”

The eyes of Renu and the elders were fixed on the money rolling on the floor. They knew what money it was.

“Is the money in the human world so strange? you can't do that Go out into the human world, and then you will know the atmosphere of the world. Because that's not possible, I'm talking nonsensical things like ruling elves or controlling humans. Isn't it important for humans as well as elves to know their own fractions?"

“… Hey."

Without responding to Zich's words, Renu spoke to the elders around him.

A heavy, low-pitched voice that can't be trusted by Renu, who has only quacked with a sound he doesn't want to hear.

It was also proof that Renu was full of anger.

“I’m going to proceed with the ritual right now and make the tree of fire run wild.”

“Sir, it is… !”

The elder, who had expressed a dissenting opinion, swallowed the back words. It was because he saw Renu's eyes looking at him.

Although Renu had a dirty personality, it was the first time I had ever seen eyes that could really kill people with just such a gaze.

“It doesn’t matter if the whole neighborhood is blown away. I don't care about anything else anymore."

Renu looked straight at Zich. Zich calmly accepted the gaze that even the hero of the reversal deserved to take a step back. Rather, the hatred was sweet, and he laughed and even provoked it.

“I’ll kill him at once!”

The elders looked at each other. He was contemplating what to do with this situation and whether to follow Renu's orders.

Their king was by no means normal. He is fed up with hatred and anger and is unable to think normally.

But they simply raised their magic. In the end, they chose to obey their master's orders.

Of course, it wasn't just a command. He was concentrating only on rituals underground, so he did not know the situation on earth very well, but he could tell at least that it was not a beneficial situation for them.

If so, it was decided that it would not be bad to risk the fate of the clan and make the last gamble.

woo woo woo!

The elders' magic touches the tree of fire. In an instant, flames began to flow around them.

Zich swung his sword.

Whoo!

Magical power stretched sharply and aimed at the elders' bodies.

quaang

However, the magical blade did not achieve its purpose. The overflowing flames extinguished Zich's magic.

“You idiot!”

Renu laughed at Zich.

“Did you know that I was conducting a ceremony in front of an enemy without any preparation?”

Was it the joy of finally feeding Zich a shot? Renu exclaimed cheerfully after a long time.

“The common consciousness and the present consciousness are different.

all! The power of the raging fire tree automatically protects us! Your insignificant skills do not work for us now!”

Zich fired several blades this time. But they too were blocked by the flame and disappeared.

“Wherever you try! Even so, I would only despair at your incompetence! All you can expect is that our consciousness fails. However, if our ritual succeeds, then I will wipe out all of you! In particular, you don't kill nicely! I'm going to kill you while playing with you so desperately!"

"Oh yeah?"

Despite Renu's curse, Zich was furious. It was so relaxing to see him picking his ears with his fingers.

(Continued on next page)

No. 216 screen

“That consciousness. Is that great?”

Zich's nonsensical question. There Renu proudly replied.

There was no reason to deny it. Isn't this ceremony something to be proud of that will make the Iron Clan great?

"of course! It is a ritual that our ancestors worked hard to create over a long period of time! Why are you scared now? It's already late! You ripped it to shreds just like I said... !”

“Oh, okay.”

Zich interrupted Renu.

There was no need to hear his unfulfilled delusions straight away. Of course, there was no reason to repair the face he had once again earned.

“It is definitely a great ceremony. Admit it.”

The magical power of the Fire Tree was really huge. I could feel that desperately just by entering the room with the fire tree.

Can you control such a fire tree? It was clear that it was an unusual ritual.

'Really, it must have been secretly made over a long period of time by mobilizing all the abilities of the Iron Clan.'

It is a ritual that has been handed down from generation to generation by elves who have a long lifespan and are good at magic. The perfect saint doesn't even need to look at it.

“But it’s not perfect, is it?”

“•••Are you going to despise even the rituals our ancestors made!”

Renu vomited again, but that was not what Zich knew. And I had no intention of destroying it.

I'm just stating the facts anyway.

“No matter how great the ritual, the difference between you and the tree’s power is too great.”

Compared to the Fire Tree, no matter how great the elders of the elves are, they are just a few ants. No, it would rather have a smaller difference in power.

“To make up for that, you have to be very sophisticated in your consciousness.”

For that reason, Zich also acknowledged the ritual. The complex and sophisticated consciousness created from generation to generation without experiment or object is still functioning.

But by nature, such a consciousness has no choice but to imply a limit.

Zich lifted Windur high. Renu, who looked suspiciously at what Zich was doing, felt anxious.

'That black... .'

Surprisingly, the sword that opened the fire tree room. Until now, I couldn't see properly because of the urgent situation of battle, but when Zich lifted it up openly, I had no choice but to pay attention again.

“Such elaborate rituals collapse in vain when the fire tree causes abnormalities. is not it?" No matter how sophisticated the ritual, no matter how great the elf elders, the power of the Fire Tree overwhelms them all.

It is because consciousness can barely control it because it is a mass of power that exists without a purpose.

“Then the solution is simple. All you have to do is give that power a transformation beyond what you calculated.”

Clearly, Zich's words made sense. But that's all. just words that make sense. Because of that, Renu didn't even fart.

"okay. Then how about giving it a try? A transformation of the power of that fire tree.”

Renu laughed and added a word.

“If you can do it.”

“••• QUICK FUCK!”

Zich let out a low laugh.

'Oh, I really can't stand it.'

The way his confident face was contorted with humiliation and hatred was a direct attack on Zich's sultry and lowly hobbies.

Especially when the enemy who was hostile to him showed such an image, Zich felt a genuine joy.

As promised with Laila, he wouldn't become a Demon King for a while, but he didn't want to give up on his hobby.

"I've seen an unusual tree before."

So I couldn't stop fluttering my tongue like this. Because you can enjoy more by knowing why, why, and for what reason your opponent is suffering.

“As I approach the tree, it suddenly resonates with this guy.”

Zich looked at the Fire Tree.

This tree is also very unique, so I wondered if it might be similar to that tree. Then don't you think this guy can resonate with my sword too?"

Five special trees I heard from Romanne. Perhaps the one he had seen in the cemetery and the one in Mentis were two of the five, he thought.

“And most importantly, my sword affirmed my thoughts.”

It was when Zich was about three steps away with his sword.

“Then, what will your consciousness be?”

Whoa!

Windur trembled.

Whoops!

The fire tree blew out a sudden burst of fire.

“What, what!”

Although it was rough and heavy, the flames that had followed the magic of the ritual well until now began to rage like crazy.

As if he had become a wild horse who realized the beauty of freedom and pursued the outside world, the flame escaped the control of consciousness.

“Hold on! Hold on anyway!”

Renu spoke quickly and raised his magic power. The elders also poured out their magic to the limit.

No, the limit has already been reached. The magic that is being produced now was literally something that was exchanged for life.

The power of the flame has been weakened for a while. It seems I have followed the rules. But soon the wild flames raised their heads again.

The elders groan. They were all sweating profusely. Some even bled through their noses.

The raging flame and the fight between those who try to suppress it.

Renu and Elders were risking their lives to fight this battle, but there was also someone here who had absolutely nothing to do with it.

“Oh, of course! This is how it happens!”

Zich was delighted to see the flamboyant fireworks.

He trudged over to Renu and the elders. He stopped at a certain distance and spoke to Renu, who was concentrating on his mind.

"how? Can you stand it?” Renu didn't answer. There was no time to answer, and it was too much to suppress the rioting flames.

I closed my eyes and concentrated. It was also believing that the flames that would protect them still existed because their consciousness had not yet been completely destroyed.

But the unfortunate thing about him was that his ears had no way to block the senses like his eyes, and as an elf, he was very sensitive to hearing.

“Hey, hey. Don't ignore it. How is the situation now? What does it feel like to sit on a running cow and hold out?”

“I did it because you asked me to do it. Isn't it awesome too? Just by touching the source of power like a cracked glass bottle, it will collapse in no time. Would you say that the empty sand castle has collapsed? How do the idiots who have built it for hundreds or thousands of years feel? Oh sorry. Was it the story of your ancestors? Sorry, I really wasn't intentional. would you believe me? Isn't it between you and me?"

“Hey, are you holding up pretty well? Since these guys are like dandelions that fly even when they sneeze, I did it for a while

I thought I would give up.”

"okay. If you try hard enough, you have to admit it. Yes, I am also a person who likes to sell hard work. When I see a disabled child wriggling like a worm, who doesn’t have as much talent as an eye, wouldn’t I have no choice but to reflect on the meaning of life?”

“Oh, what the hell is life! What is the meaning of being born into this world as a human being who has vain ambition and ends up living such a tragic life where all roads are blocked and they can only pray with the elderly? Whether he is born or not, nothing has changed in this world!” “Okay, good job! I'll support you. Be strong, be strong! Stay strong, strength!” “Uh, uh, hey! Just a little more focus! The second old man next to you is about to take your breath away! You are a precious elder in your clan! You can't let it die! Numbers I've reduced enough! Now it wouldn't be that much of a burden. The rest you will have to work hard to support!”

Whoops!

A thin line of blood ran from the corner of Renu's lips, concentrating on his mind. I bit my teeth so badly that the gums collapsed.

The countenances of the elders standing next to him also burned with anger and shame.

Is it because my mind is shaken? Or did it have to be like that?

A single spark of control was completely out of control.

Whoops!

“Aaaaaaaaah!”

Unlucky enough, the flame engulfed one of the elders during the ceremony.

Fortunately, the power of the flame was still weak, but it was more unfortunate for the Elder.

He had to experience the pain of being burned alive with his whole body on fire. It would be comforting if it was comforting to be able to leave even the last scream of death.

That was the prelude to the collapse. It was felt that the power of consciousness was definitely weakening, whether it was because one person fell out and the power was pushed back in earnest, or it was more agitated by the death of a colleague.

It is a tree of fire that was forced to run wild. In line with the resonance caused by Windur, the Fire Tree really savagely spewed flames around it.

It was a majestic sight. And it was a terrifying sight.

Fireworks raging from all directions float around the room.

“Aww!”

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"

The elders, engulfed in flames, run around screaming miserably. But the fire was not extinguished.

👌👌👌👌👌

Another elder next to him interrupted the ceremony and sprinkled water magic on those set on fire, but the flames did not go out. Rather, even the elder who used magic was engulfed in flames.

A small scream was heard from outside. Perhaps the flames of the Fire Tree had spread to the rest of the castle.

But even that kind of flame didn't come to Zich's side.

Zich looked at Windur.

“You really deserve it.”

After all, choosing this guy instead of the tornium was the right answer.

Reflecting the flames, Windur glows in a pale red color. It was as if he was shrugging his shoulders in euphoria.

“Oh oh oh oh!”

It was already conscious, and Nabal, then, had crossed the waters. The two elders rushed to Zich as if they were going to kill Zeeman, the culprit of the situation, somehow.

It was very eerie to see him rushing to his body with only one flesh to kill Zich without even paying attention to the fire on his body.

However, their desperate determination was no different from a fly swarming to Zich.

Whoo!

clean island. With that alone, the elders' waists were clearly divided.

dump! dump!

They couldn't even approach Zich, and they turned into cold corpses.

Aww!

A fireball fell on the body. Their bodies, which were still on fire, were turned to ashes in an instant.

It ended with those two. The lives of all the elders who had been diligently performing rituals for the future of their clan were lost in this shady basement.

All that's left is Zich holding Windur. And it was Renu hanging his shoulders from the base of the fire tree.

The flame was also avoiding Renu's side. Zich remembered the first time he opened the door to this room.

'The flames at that time also avoided that guy.'

Of course, it was not completely damaged, so he suffered burns all over his body, but those who were swallowed by the flames that erupted at that time were all burned to death.

With that in mind, Renu must have had a way to avoid the flames in any way.

Zich walked in front of Renu. Renu did not raise his head.

“Are you almost done with what you can do?”

As he would do to a friend he had been close with since childhood, Zich spoke kindly.

(Continued on next page)

No. 217 screen

Renu's shoulder, which had been standing still, trembled. Zich did not miss that minute movement.

Whoo!

Something passed in front of Zich, who took a step back.

'Five!'

It was a type of object that was quite familiar to Zich. A lump of metal in the shape of a branch. Seeing that it was very similar to his own sword, Zich had an intuition.

'That's the key he had.'

Perhaps that was the reason why the flames of the Tree of Fire were repelling, Zich decided.

However, it would be an insult to Windur to compare it with the Windur that Sieg has.

'The proof of that is that the first time I didn't properly extinguish the flame of the tree of fire.'

If Windur was the same level as that piece of metal, Zich of the world should have been wrapped in bandages like Renu.

Renu shook his head. Zich laughed hysterically. Renu's eyes. That's what Zich saw a lot.

Eyes that have lost everything they wanted and hoped for, lost even hope, and are in despair.

It's not the eyes that Zich likes very much. A person who has lost all hope is just a breathing doll.

'The fun of tormenting is gone.'

Fortunately, there was another light in Renu's eyes. Red and intense hatred. A sense of revenge for those who destroyed everything.

The guy was burning his anger against Zeek.

And that, too, was familiar to Zich. No, I'm not used to it, so it was a feeling that reached my senses.

You don't even need to go back until you come back. Among the people I've met since returning, there weren't many people who saw Zich like that.

“… Did I ask if I was done with what I could do?”

“ O  ”
“o”.

On the one hand, there is a lot of frost in winter. On the one hand, it is spring with a lot of warm wind. Of course, looking at the situation, spring was definitely strange.

“I don’t know what you expected ,  but there is still one left.”

"okay?"

Jack was a little surprised. He only asked for ridicule, but he didn't know that there were still more Renus left.

But that was also for a while.

“After all, this is our Renuant Dras-sama. Rabbit cubs usually dig several burrows to escape, right? It’s good that cowardly beings have a lot in common.”

"is it."

“Now it’s a bit calmer. How nice it would be if it was earlier. Oh, was that impossible? Human beings don't change very well unless they die right before they die. Elves are similar. Then it's me who urged your change. I don't need to say thank you. It makes me happy just to think that I have influenced other people’s good changes.”

"okay. If you know me so well, do you know what I'm thinking right now?"

"Sure."

It is not a difficult question.

“You want to kill me.”

Just like all beings who have stood in Renu's position so far have been.

“Inflict pain, inflict despair, humiliate, and such things will no longer be of any interest to me.”

The mindset itself will be different from the people who have been arguing about how to kill them so far.

“Just, just, just, just want to see my breath run out. right?"

«_=_ » 
O  • • •

Renu smiled faintly. There was no Renuant Dras, the king of the Iron Clan, that Zich had ever seen.

There is only 'Renu' whose only purpose is to get revenge on Zich.

“So, the last remaining attempt, give it a try. do you know Will that attempt succeed?”

Whoops!

A terrifying cracking sound was heard. The blood that flowed from the wound fell like rainwater flowing through the crevice of the rock.

What was pierced was Renu's abdomen. But Zich didn't attack. Penetrating Renu's abdomen was the key that Renu was holding.

It was Renu himself who stabbed Renu in the stomach.

It's definitely an abnormal situation. However, Zich's complexion did not change.

“Aren’t you a pervert who takes pleasure in pain?”

“Cool! nice… 👌👌👌 ! do not worry… La… . That's ah... because you are.”

Renu laughed as he vomited blood from his mouth. Being engulfed in madness, his pain and wounds are no longer a hindrance.

“Are you gaining strength by sacrificing your life or soul?”

“… noticed... me?"

“It’s a technique often used by corner rats. If I don't have the ability, I'll have to cut my life off. It's going to be really hard for people who don't have the ability to live. Do not sympathize.”

“I need to… none… . no more... He's a virgin... can do... .”

Quad Duck!

Twist the key that pierced the abdomen and drive it deeper.

“Because there won’t be!”

Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

Fire fell from the tree of fire. Zich, who believed in Windur and watched the fireball coming down, was taken aback and backed away.

Aww!

A fireball hit the spot where Zich was. Zich touched the hem of his own garment. The charred part crumbled and crumbled.

'Windur doesn't work.'

Zich kept a little more distance. Renu, on the other hand, did not move a single step. He smiled a little and looked at Zich with a bright blue color.

Aww!

Fireworks also fell on Renu. His key could not protect a flame that even Windur could not protect.

His bandages burned in an instant, revealing his hideous body. Burning pain is the most painful. Even so, Renu laughed. it was crazy

“Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!”

Flames swirled around him with a mad laugh. The flames surrounding his body grew bigger and bigger. The heat in the surrounding space rose rapidly and became like a steamer.

Renu looked at Zich. At that time, he had the purest and brightest expression on his face that Zich had ever seen.

"die."

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

The castle was engulfed in flames.

* * *

The battle of Mentis was completely tilted. It was a battlefield that was still tilting.

After a certain amount of time, the commander decided that it was no longer necessary to pretend to be attacked and continued the landing of Mentis again, and the victory quickly shifted to the Allied Forces.

There were corpses all over the Mentis, but the number was much higher than that of the Iron Clan. Flame troopers, who once forced the Allies to retreat, now have few left.

win soon When the Allied Forces recalled the thought, the incident occurred.

Aww!

A huge explosion swept around. The sound was so loud that the soldiers who risked their lives in battle instinctively covered their ears and fell to the ground.

“What, what!”

"what's the matter!"

Regardless of the enemy, the soldiers find the cause of the binge drinking. But it didn't take long to find out why.

Mentis's castle was burning bright red. Until now, the castle had a history of spewing fire with the power of the Fire Tree several times, but this time it was different.

Not only the castle, but also the walls were covered with a huge fire. It is like a flame burning with a castle as a raw material.

The moving flame troopers suddenly disappeared.

Even in the magic of the lake's tears, the disappearance of those that had tormented the Allied Forces was definitely a situation that benefited the Allied Forces.

But none of the Allies liked it. It was because it was clear that the flame that swallowed the castle and the disappearance of the flame trooper had something to do with it.

Whoops!

Something came out of the castle through the flames. It moved quickly and came all the way to the Allied camp in an instant.

Allied forces instinctively aimed at it, but there was someone who stopped it.

“Not the enemy.”

Hans said as he lowered the arm of the elf with the weapon. And he said to the one who approached him.

“Welcome, Zich.”

Shaking off the sparks left on his shoulder, Zich raised his hand.

“The battle looks good.”

“Thanks to Ziek, the mentis was almost completely conquered.”

And Hans looked at the burning castle.

“But what is that?”

“The king of the Iron clan is the last to burn his own life.”

Hans as well as the elves next to him looked at the flame in amazement. In particular, the elves of the Iron Clan were frightened.

According to Zich, it means that the king they serve, at least, is dying.

“Then are you done?”

“No, it won’t be.”

Seeing the blazing flames, Zich answered quite confidently.

But the war is not over yet. It wasn't the right time to be immersed in the magnificence of the blazing fire.

“Your bastard will tell you!”

A soldier from the Iron Clan who was nearby rushed in. It seems that he was an elf who was very loyal to Renu.

But it was objection. And the reward for that courage was unwittingly splitting in two.

Whoa!

Blood and organs were splattered, and the 'elf' body was scattered on the floor.

“Whatever the subject matter is… .”

Zich clicked his tongue. The other members of the Iron Clan, who were about to rush at Zich, flinched. With just one blow, he recognized that Zich was a far-fetched opponent.

With that, the chance to attack Zich was over. Again, the Allies wielded their weapons against the Iron Clan, and the battle resumed.

But Zich was not involved in the battle. I quietly looked at the flames of the castle.

“… Zeek, it was just... .”

Hans asked as his complexion changed.

“I’ve been using it for a while. The power of that claw one seems to be a pretty interesting thing.”

“Is the situation the same as in Violuwin?”

"right."

Hans nodded. Not all of the doubts have been resolved, but it's not something Jik is doing anyway. It didn't matter to him anymore.

“Zeek!”

After a while, Layla came along with Snock. Romane was also involved.

“Are there any injuries?”

“As you can see.”

Zich opened his arms to announce his well-being. There were only a few burn marks on the hem, but Zich's body was in good health.

“How did that happen?”

Romanne looked at the castle and asked. Zich gave Hans the same answer this time as he did.

“Renuent Drass is the flame that burns the last life.”

“•••The king of the Iron Clan?”

“It’s the trump card that you risk your life for. It’s like the kick that comes out when you’re driven as fast as you can.”

“•••You are truly amazing.”

Romanne's voice had an emotion that could even be described as a kind of homage. But it had to be.

It was this stranger brought by her granddaughter who was most active in this war sparked by the Iron Clan.

“Let’s hear the compliments later. The war is not over yet.”

“Isn’t it over? If that spark was the last effort of the king of the Iron Clan, wouldn't it be an exaggeration to say that it was over?"

As long as the king dies and loses the battle, the fall of the Iron Clan cannot be prevented. Or maybe you just want to say that we should not be vigilant until the end?

But Zich's words were neither a metaphor nor anything.

“That fire may be Renuant Dras' last move, but it will never be over. Rather, on the contrary, this guy's tantrums will probably start from now on.”

“What… .”

Aww!

Romanne's question was interrupted by a new explosion. But she didn't have to be embarrassed.

Because the flames of the castle were answering the questions instead.

The flame expanded violently. As if about to soar to the end of the sky, he called out his body and expanded in all directions.

And the people in Mentis could soon witness a startling sight.

kuung

A huge firework went off.

(Continued on next page)

No. 218 screen

Everyone around looked at the flame. It didn't matter if it was the Iron Clan and the Allied Forces.

The flame takes another step.

Koo!

There was no such thing as mass in fire, but the earth shook slightly as the flame stepped forward, as if walking by a giant.

The flame just resembles a flame trooper. Body and limbs made of blazing flames, and parts like the head protruding above the shoulders.

But there was another point. It was huge.

It would not be surprising to claim that it was literally a mythical monster that boasted one size of a castle.

“••• Fire giant.”

An elf nearby murmured. The surrounding elves nodded slightly. They also had the same image as the elf who spoke.

And it was the same with Zich's group.

“•••Is that Renuant Dras’s tantrum?”

Romanne's accent is very hard.

Extreme tension gripped her. Others were under pressure as well, but Romane did it more.

The tears of the lake she was holding continued to send warnings.

The magic of the lake's tears, which still sprinkles his presence on the majority of mentees, burned without leaving a trace the moment he approached the fire giant.

'It burns the magic of water.'

There was a thrill in its formidable power. And a sense of crisis arose. If that was Renu's move, it would never be good for the Allied Forces.

"That's right. Still, it seems to be the power that I took with my own life, so it won't last long."

“A guy like that is dangerous even for a short time!”

Short time something. For even a moment, he was extremely threatening.

Whoops!

A change occurred in the face of the fire giant. Through the surface of the blazing fire, something poked out a face.

“… Renuant Dras.”

Romanne's murmuring revealed its identity.

“He’s not dead yet.”

Unlike the serious Romane, Zich's attitude was blunt. It was time to emphasize the dangers of the fiery giants of the stuffy Romanne.

Zich and Renu's eyes met.

Although there was a considerable distance, Sieg could see Renu without difficulty. And that seemed to be the case with Renu.

Renu chuckled.

[you • • • o  • • • uh • • • uh • • • I ]

It was difficult to understand the words that came out of Renu's mouth, whether the language organ had been burned down or whether his ability to speak the language had deteriorated. However, the fact that he was delighted was communicated only by his voice.

Whoo!

The fire giant swings his arms. A huge fireball was fired.

Whoops!

Fortunately, the attack escaped Mentis and fell into the lake. He even looked like he was staggering as he couldn't control his body properly.

But no one laughed at the ridiculous move.

Big ripples and water vapor gushing out. The power of the flame was so great that it made the lake that was hit directly look like it had a hole in it for a moment.

[ O • • • | J

Perhaps out of anger, Renu lets out a strange scream.

Renu waved his arm once more. Fortunately, this time it went wrong. Fireworks exploded in the woods beyond the lake.

Aww!

Fireworks are rising from afar. As if a volcano had erupted, flames cut through the sky and fragments spurted out in all directions.

“Oh, oh oh oh!”

“King!”

Unlike the Allied Forces, who lost their words, the Iron Clan was delighted. They were delighted to see their king suddenly appear wielding great power just before their eyes of defeat.

They flocked to the feet of the fire giants, as if running to their parents.

“King! Come on, wipe out those weird things!”

“Victory for our clan! Glory to our King!”

Seeing that, Zich said a word.

“Aren’t they like immature kids running to their mother?”

Hearing that, all the elves looked at Zich with a blank expression.

To compare the current situation with such a trivial situation. Only Zich and the others responded calmly.

Alright, it was the Iron Clan that ran to the fire giant, but their fate was not very good.

Whoops!

As if about to take another step, the fire giant raised his feet again.

The iron clan cheered. He seems to have thought that the fire giant would trample the Allied Forces at any moment.

But it was not the Allied Forces that he trampled on.

“Uh, uh! Wow, king! Not here!”

“Here we are! Everyone, step elsewhere... Ugh, ah ah ah ah ah!”

Aww!

There was a thought that they might trample on them, but there were also times that their feet came too quickly. The elves of the Iron Clan, trampled upon by the fire giant, were crushed and burned to ashes.

“King! It's us! A loyal servant of Your Majesty!”

It seems that there was a misunderstanding. Kendis put magical energy into their necks and announced their identities.

But they misunderstood Renu's intentions.

[Si ••• off… Looooooooo!]

once again swing your arms This time it didn't go away. The flame hit the Iron Clan directly.

Aww!

The elves of the Iron Clan screamed. Even in the roar of the explosion, their terrifying screams were audible.

“Aww!”

Kendis, who had bravely commanded the Iron Clan, was engulfed in fire, even under adverse circumstances due to her loyalty to the clan and the king.

To no avail, to put out the fire, he died painfully.

Those caught up in the explosion and those covered in flames all scream and die.

The first attack they hit was directed at their subordinates. It really was such a thing.

“… How are you going to deal with it?”

Layla asked. She too felt threatened by the fire giant. No, she was well versed in magic, so she didn't even know that she felt better than others.

"do not worry. look at you and face

Don’t do it.”

“Then who are you going to fight with?”

“I don’t need anyone.”

Zich slung Windur over his shoulder. And it was a very light step.

“Alone is enough.”

"what? No matter how much you are!”

The greatness of Zich is something that even Layla acknowledged, but his opponent was too bad. The fire giant in front of me was stronger than anything I had ever met.

However, Zich only ruffled his hands and did not stop his feet. Rather, he spoke to Romanne.

“Give me the army. Being caught up in the fight that will take place from now on is nothing but the death of a dog.”

“Are you really going to go alone!”

Romanne said urgently. In her view, Zich's actions were no different from suicide.

Snock hugged Nowtm and alternately looked at Zich and the Fire Giant. It didn't dry out like Laila and Romane.

Having absolute faith in Zich, he thought he had an idea.

However, the existence of the fire giant was a being that destroys common sense, so there was a bit of anxiety.

Hans, on the other hand, was not agitated at all.

“How many bites would you like?”

Rather, he even asked Zich a question.

“As far as possible. I'd like to tell them to leave the island, but I don't think there's much time for that."

"all right."

Hans leaned against Zich's back. Then he turned and looked at the group.

“Come on, let’s take the army.”

“… Do you really think Zich can beat that giant? Even single?”

"Yes."

At Hans' resolute reply, Lyla was at a loss for words. I knew that my faith in Zich had gone to the blind spot, but I'm sure I'll be able to answer without hesitation in this kind of situation.

But it wasn't just his belief in Zich that made Hans confident.

“After coming out of the castle, I saw Zich using his powers.”

"Huh'?"

“I don’t know how you did it, but the current Zich-nim is different from usual. Perhaps you are in a similar situation to Violuwin.”

“Violwin?”

Something slipped through Layla's head.

“… no way!"

“Are you pointing out something?”

Romanne asked.

"yes I have it."

If only Zich was really like that back then.

“I don’t think I really need any help.”

Snock and Knowtt, who had grasped the situation the same as Layla, nodded their heads. However, Romanne, who did not have the same experience as them, was only bewildered by the sudden change in their appearance.

A signal rings from behind. Allied forces began to retreat in unison.

In contrast, the Iron Clan could not do this or that. The enemy in the future and their king who seems to have gone crazy behind them are blocking them.

However, as the Allied forces withdrew and space became available, they also began to distance themselves from their king.

Anyway, their king was crazy.

When the elves distanced themselves from the fire giant like the ebb and flow, Zeek was the only one to walk through it.

[flaw… !]

Renu laughed. It was much worse than before, and her face, which had melted and tangled up, was distorted in an ugly way. Now, even calling it an elf's face was hesitant to say.

[you… you, lord... kill... killed... all!]

“Now I can’t even speak.”

For a person who tried to rule over elves and even rule over humans, it was a very down-to-earth look. But at least the power he has now is formidable.

[G, now... silver… I, go, go strong… !]

The fire giant raised his arm.

[you… you see... all… strong!]

Whoo!

was swung as it was. The pressure of the raging fire and the heat that seems to burn everything. It turned towards Zich with a clear murderous intent.

Zich grabbed Windur and fixed it.

"You're just mistaking it all the way to the end."

And Zich had a very kind heart to correct that misunderstanding.

Whoo!

Zich swung Windur. The fist of the fire giant and Windur met.

Aww!

A roar that reverberates across the sky. Once again the elves covered their ears. But to understand the situation, only his eyes looked at the place where the roar was coming from. The place where the fire giant slammed his huge fist down.

"Huh'?"

" uh?"

The elves stopped moving. I forgot to cover my ears and run away. I froze in the unrealistic situation I saw.

[•••Ah?]

The same goes for fire giants. Renu's face turned to the right. This is where the arms that were blown towards Zich are there.

there was no All that was left was a red flame burning from the shoulder area. It was as if blood had been splattered.

I look at Jack again. He should have been screaming with his fists squashed and burning, but he was fine. Far from that, there were no traces of destruction left around him.

[Eww… Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ]

Whoops!

There was a spark at the cut surface. In an instant, the arm was regenerated.

“It can also be played.”

Zich murmured the scene as if it were a fallen leaf.

[Aaaaah!]

hooo

Once again the fire giant blew his fist. intense pressure. fatal heat.

But this time the result was the same.

Aww!

Seeing the flying arm once again, Le Nuga widened his eyes.

“How about slowly correcting the misunderstanding? Renuant Dras. Even now, I am stronger than you.”

Zich smiled kindly and said to Renu.

“Was your little hope sweet?”

(Continued on next page)

[That •••Ah... iced coffee… AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Renu screamed in all sorts of negative emotions: anger, hatred, humiliation, shame.

[Lord, week, die... uh... uh uh uh uh!]

Once again the regenerated arm is swung. The flames that made up his arms seemed to burn more intensely.

Aww!

This time the arm didn't go away. It even reached the target place smoothly. Renu's mouth widened.

[Lord, week, killed... !]

“Yeah, no.”

A hateful voice was heard.

It does not capture sounds from far away with excellent hearing as before. I heard it right next door.

[right… !]

Renu looked to the side in surprise and saw Zich jumping up to the giant's head.

" for now."

Zich grabbed Windur with both hands.

“Let’s go back a little!”

swung with power

quaang

The fire giant's head was severely broken.

[Ke-e-e-e-e!]

Renu screamed and the fire giant's body wobbled.

Koo Kung!

I took a step backwards to keep my balance, but the speed of my upper body was leaning too fast. In the end, the fire giant stumbled backwards.

[right… Ah… Eww… !]

The fire giant struggles with his arms to get up. Beside him, Zich sat down.

'You're still fine.'

It was cut with quite a bit of force, but it couldn't even destroy the head of Renu's giant.

'Do you know how to defend yourself.'

Just before Windur struck the Fire Giant directly on the head, Zich didn't miss the fact that a wall of bright red fire had formed around its head.

The wall of fire failed to completely block Windur, but it was able to successfully reduce its power.

As a result, the fire giant was able to avoid the worst of the situation: his head was shattered.

'I don't know if that's his worst situation.'

do you know Just as his arms were regenerated in an instant, he might even be able to regenerate his head.

Even if Renu disappears, it may be able to move on its own.

Renu, who raised his upper body with his arms on the ground, noticed Zich standing next to him.

[Eww… Ah… iced coffee… ！]

Whoo!

As if catching an insect with the palm of his hand, the bottom of his hand came over Zich. The flames that made up his arms seemed to be getting fiercer.

quaang

This time, the fire giant's arm collided with Windur and flew away. However, Zich noticed a clear difference from before.

'This time to Sangwan.'

Unlike before, where I had blown up to the shoulder, the number of blown parts was reduced this time. The pressure I felt in my hands was definitely greater than before.

'Are you getting stronger?'

If you think about it a while ago when you couldn't even target the attack properly, it would be more accurate to say that you started handling your own power properly.

[OMG… Ahhh… !]

Renu shouted like a child annoyed because things didn't work out. The fire giant jumped up and attacked Zich.

Zich blocked and dodged the attack and swung his Windur towards the fire giant's body.

stumble!

Again, the fire giant lost its balance. But he took a big step backwards and didn't fall like before.

Zich attacked once again.

Again the fire giant steps back. And attack again.

Zich's attack was very bitter. The fire giant could not afford to dare to counterattack.

But slowly and surely the fire giant's pace slowed down.

with a splash!

The fire giant, who was pushed over Mentis and pushed to the lake, dipped his feet in the lake. Immediately, the lake near the bridge began to boil, spewing water vapor.

The fire giant stepped back a little further. Around the time the lake water shimmers near the giant's shank.

The fire giant stopped walking backwards.

Zich swung Windur again. The fire giant also swung his fists in front of each other.

quaang

A roar rang once more. But the fire giant did not back down this time. The arm that collided with Windur was still intact.

[. • •hh/ •three hhh/ • • I]

Renu lets out an unlucky laugh. The fire giant swung his arms towards the floating Zich.

Zich's new model flew backwards.

kuung

The jig fell on the shore of the lake and dust rose. The crash sound was strong, so I thought that Zich was seriously injured.

However, the dust had subsided and Zich appeared unaffected.

In a small crater on the shore of the lake, Zich brushed off the dirt that had settled on his clothes.

[This... now my... is... stronger... !]

"Oh yeah. Think your way.”

Not paying any more attention to Renu's words, Zich looked back. In the distance, you can see the Allied Forces withdrawing.

'Is this enough?'

There is a distance and each one of them is a strong elf, so even if they fight a little intensely in the future, they will not be involved.

“Hey, Renuant Dras.”

Zich walked to the lake and talked to him.

“Do you know why I didn’t stop you from harming yourself?”

with a splash!

Zich's feet were submerged in the lake. He continued into the lake, not even paying attention to the wetness of his shoes and trousers.

“If it were normal, I would have stopped you. To be honest, even in a country that deliberately leaves a conspiracy to trample on the last hope, the magic of the Fire Tree was intimidating.”

As long as there's a good chance that Renu's last card is somehow connected to the tree of fire, it's better to blow Renu's head cleanly.

“But now it’s different from usual.”

Zich looked down at Windur.

Being able to open the door in the basement of the castle, this guy really seemed like a guy who had a clear connection to the ancient empire.

Zich raised his magic. A huge amount of magical power, which was different from the one she had used so far, erupted from within her body.

'I've never tasted it before.'

There was a time when I was able to use all of my magic in Violuwin, but at that time, I had to suppress it quite a bit.

This is because, perhaps, it is because the city is unfolding before the city, and if you make a mistake, you could drive the city into a state of destruction.

'But now there's nothing to disturb.' The place is in the forest far away from the in-house. Mentis is an empty city, and the Allied Forces are far away so they will be able to protect themselves enough.

'Of course, you still have to make some adjustments.'

If you run wildly, there is a risk of blowing up the library inside the Mentis, and the possibility that the Allied Forces will be caught up increases.

Besides, your own body will not be able to withstand it.

'You'll still be able to enjoy it enough.' Zich's eyes gleamed eerily.

[right… .]

Renu flinched. The fire giant took a step back.

Le nuneun did not understand why he did it. Got tremendous power it is now possible to fully control. Another's strength is something not even touch their toes.

But at the very least, to step back because of the eyes of a single human being. feel the fear

It wasn't a denial of himself, but Renou genuinely didn't understand.

But Renu was soon able to get the answer.

A terrible nightmare for him.

“Then let’s play, Renuent de Las.”

fault!

Zich jumped. Windur was clenched in his hand.

The fire giant also moved. Interlace both hands and lift them up high. A fierce flame burned in his hand.

Whoo!

He slammed it straight down towards Zich. the two collided

quaaaang

The pressure of the flame disappears and the harsh heat dissipates. A fierce slash fell between them.

Layla led Hans and Snock to the end of Mentis with Romane.

Occasionally, he looked back and confirmed the battle between Zich and the Fire Giant, but, as Zich said, he was focused on leaving the island.

But at some point they had no choice but to stop.

“Lyla! Help!”

Romanne hastily lifted the tears of the lake. Layla sat next to her and, together, touched the tears of the lake.

Whoa!

The tears of the lake vibrated lightly, and the magic of the water spread.

This time, the magic power did not disperse widely, but gathered densely while drawing a certain boundary. A soft blue light shone all around.

"come!"

“Everyone is vigilant!” Romanne and Layla shouted loudly. Hans, Snok, and the other elves hastily set up their defenses in their own way.

wow!

This is what it feels like to walk backwards through a raging rapid.

A storm of magical power swept over them as if it was about to sweep away everything around them.

Occasionally, even the remnants of scorching heat and eerie swords struck them. Fortunately, thanks to the tears of the lake, they survived it all.

But no one was happy.

No, to be precise, I didn't have time to care about joy.

Far away, there was a battle that looked like something out of a myth.

The fire giant was amazing. It burns and smashes everywhere with its huge size and overwhelming heat.

It was thought that it would be extremely difficult or even impossible to defeat that fire giant even if the Allied Forces were all gathered together.

But the fire giant was being mistreated. Not even a being that seems to pop out of a myth like himself, but to a single human being.

Cuckoo Cuckoo!

In the distance, on the shore of the lake, the traces of a great slash are engraved. The deep and wide lake sways with high waves as if hit directly by a typhoon in a storm of falling magical power.

The most impressive sight was that a large cliff near the lake was hit by a magical blade and collapsed.

Quarrrr!

The shape of the cliff cut at an angle as if cutting a cake disappeared beneath the surface of the lake, creating a white spray. Those who watched it could not find the words to say.

“•••Mr. Leila? That guy named Zik.”

Romanne was careful with her luck. He licks his lips to say a few words, then closes them.

He wanted to say something, but he seemed reluctant. But if she couldn't stand it, she eventually asked the question.

“Are you really human?”

“For now.”

But Layla understood Romanne's feelings well.

Who the hell would think of a human being who is indiscriminately destroying the surrounding environment and driving fire giants?

Layla was able to realize once again how amazing, terrifying, and terrifying the existence of Zeik was.

The Demon King of Power Siegmore was not born for nothing.

“Still, that appearance will be temporary. I’ve been like that before, but I’m back soon.”

“Oh, is that so? There seems to be a way to boost the power for a while.”

Romanne had a look of reassurance. It was his reaction when his common sense was kept, regardless of the danger level of Zich or anything like that.

Because of this, Layla could not say that Zich would wield such power without any restrictions, even if not now, in a short period of time.

“But for now, the war seems to be over.”

In the eyes of the people, the fire giant, whose body had been mutilated, was seen toppling over.


[Uh • • • Aww- • • Aaaah • • •! ] Renu lets out a moan. The fire giant did not move.

The flame, which had a bright red color, was very dark. The surrounding lakes also spewed water vapor, but there was no violent boiling up until now.

chin!

Zich sat down next to Renu, on the face of the giant. Even if the momentum was dead, the figure of him standing on the blazing flame looked mysterious.

“You die when you hit me like this.”

Zich glanced at the wrecked fire giant.

[you… you… you uh... !]

Whoops!

Windur stuck in Renu's head as if he was about to vomit a curse.

“I played enough. Stop sleeping now.”

Kwajik!

He twisted the stuck Windur and slashed Renu's face.

Something was leaking out of Renu's face, making it unclear whether it was blood or flames.

Whoops!

The fire giant scattered flames and disappeared. One man and one ball fell into the lake.

Thus, the great war that involved all the elves of the Adrowon Great Forest ended.

(Continued on next page)

Shake it!

One sheet of paper goes over. The tattered, fragile state of the book spoke of the years it had been through.

If I gave a hastily strong shock, it would crumble even in an instant, damaging the many characters I had cherished for a long time. So, I was very careful with my hand turning the paper.

It was a space with a soft light leaking in.

It is a place where sunlight does not reach directly, so artificial lighting is required even in broad daylight. Several candles on the long desk filled the lack of light sources.

chin!

The book was covered. A little bit of dust wafts. The person reading the book stirred the dust away with his hand.

And I glanced at the cover once. I felt the rough surface of an old leather cover that had endured many years.

“Did you find anything?”

A voice was heard from behind. The one reading the book, Laila, turned her head. Zich was trudging in.

"I'm here?"

“I came here because I have been stuck here since dawn. I'm afraid he's not a wizard, so I can't stop his curiosity."

“What do you mean?”

It is true that she has been in this library since dawn, but it was still early enough.

Zich shrugged and sat across from her.

“Are you okay with your injuries?” Zich was seriously wounded in the last battle. It wasn't life-threatening or left with sequelae, but it wasn't an injury to just let it go.

“I’m fine. If it wasn't healed after pouring the potion like that, I would have attacked Carwiman to take responsibility."

“I’m scared because I think you would really do it.”

It seemed that Zich would do it casually against the Carwiman, who was arguing with the product and intimidating the store.

But Zich shook his head.

“It’s a joke, it’s a joke. I don't really do that. I have no intention of arguing against them.”

At least as long as the Killing Machines and Saints of the Tasnia Plains kept their eyes open, I didn't want to fight against them.

Zich's half-joking, half-sincere gentleness, E. Lila chuckled.

“By the way, I didn’t know that you, who pushed the fire giant so one-sidedly, would be hurt. I was really surprised.”

“As I said before, the wounds that Renu did were absolutely not.”

The reason Zich was injured was because of his own magical power.

It was because he did some additions or subtractions, but he did not take care of his body because he was drunk with the power he could freely wield after a long time.

The unfamiliar flow of huge magical power became huge violence and ravaged the enemy, but it also stuck its teeth in its owner.

“Still, it was exciting. Every time I mobilized my mana to the fullest, it felt like my veins were about to burst. That was the result.”

“I thought, did you have a masochist-like side?”

With an awake look, Layla pulled the chair back a little. Zich waved his hand.

“That said, it was good to deal with my original magic. I don't like being bullied and rejoicing. If you harass others, you harass them.”

"but… .”

To Zich's persuasive remarks, Lila affirmed without hesitation and pulled the chair forward again.

“Did you find anything?”

Zich glanced at the book in front of Layla.

"does not exist. Not yet."

“Not yet… .”

Zich looked around.

“But will the time come when we will find something?”

There was a reason why Zich said that.

They were in the library in Mentis, Calfnal.

One of the reasons they participated in this war. Layla's Memory, the Ancient Empire, Windur, etc. Where they might be able to get the information they're looking for.

I have already received permission to enter. There were no kings who would refuse the not-so-difficult request of Zich, the great benefactor of the Ardro One Great Forest.

But when they first came here, Zich and the others had to stand still for a while.

To be honest, I expected it. No, I thought I did. It's a book that the long-lived elves have been collecting for a really long time, so the amount is no joke.

'But this is beyond imagination.'

After coming to Calfnal and seeing the collection for themselves, they had no choice but to change their thinking. Their expectations were too light.

Usually, when you think of a library, the images that come to mind are the bookshelves filling the walls and the books tightly packed inside.

But Calfnal was different. What Dronean said, 'It is nothing more than a collection of books brought by our ancestors' was not an exaggeration or anything.

It's not even listed on a bookshelf, let alone categorized. Books stacked randomly without regularity fill the space.

Except for the barely-passed road, every space was filled with books stacked up to the ceiling.

The problem was that there were four more such spaces underground.

In other words, Zich and his party have to find the book they want from among the books stacked randomly on five floors. Moreover, there was no guarantee that they would find the book they wanted.

“We must find a way.” Laila had no other solution. I was just thinking of going through at least one more book until I come up with a solution for now.

Remove the checked books and take out the new books piled next to them. and unfolded.

Zich looked at the book. He was an unknown character.

“Do you know the letters?”

“No, not even my knowledge knows everything. What we're looking for may have something to do with the Ancient Empire, so we're just looking for something similar to this." Layla took a piece of paper from the magic box and shook it. It was a rubbish from Violwin's grave.

“Neither is this.”

Layla also put the book aside. And I pulled out another book.

Her gaze turned back and she took a deep breath. The overwhelming amount of books in her collection seemed to have upset her.

“Aren’t you in such a hurry? It’s not like there’s something going on.”

Zich took out a book and said: But Layla denied him.

“Still, I can't stay here forever. And above all, you won't be bored."

“Are you thinking of me? I mean, I'm just going to be impressed. I think I’m going to cry.”

Zich pressed his eyes shut. Of course, there were no traces of tears on his sleeve, not even the slightest stain.

“Because you are yielding.”

"Huh?"

Layla said without taking her eyes off the book.

“You are following my advice not to become a Demon King, even temporarily. Then I have to adapt to you.”

I didn't know that Layla was thinking that way.

"what? Why do you look like that?”

“No, I was a little surprised.”

“Are you surprised? Since you're doing my favor, I need to give you something that will benefit you in balance. Let me know if you need anything in the future. I will do my best to help you. what is it… .”

Layla opened her mouth with a slightly gritty expression on her face.

“Yeah, you have some weird hobbies. I'll help you with that too, so don't hesitate to tell me in the future."

There is only one hobby that comes to mind when it comes to Zich's hobbies, which Laila finds gritty. Zich smiled mischievously.

"what. Are you trying to bully other guys like me now? Okay, I can't ignore you if you're interested. Let's start with how to get a wife to know what niggas don't like... .”

“I don’t care, you idiot!”

Lila flinched as she tried to throw the book she was reading.

It's not yours, and it's an old, worn-out book. There is a high possibility that it will be damaged if thrown carelessly. She carefully put the book down.

Then he kicked Zich's shin as he giggled.

* * *

It was around lunchtime when Zich and Layla came out of Calfnal. Leila, who was constantly looking for books, was forced by Zich to lunch.

Under the sun rising in the middle of the sky, the appearance of the mentis was active. A large number of soldiers roamed the island. However, the atmosphere was not very good.

The original battlefield is such a law. A colleague who had been fighting with me until yesterday turns into a corpse and rolls on the floor.

The living person closes the eyes of his dead comrade, with both eyes wide open to see what is so bitter. It was seen all over the place.

Between them, Zich and Lila walked quietly.

“Where are you going?”

"Castle. It's a bit like eating here."

"what? Have you ever had such an emotional side?”

“It’s common sense even if you don’t have to be emotional.”

“… The word common sense comes out of your mouth.”

Lila covers her mouth and looks at Zich with trembling eyes. Perhaps she was more surprised than when she saw the fire giant now.

Jack didn't say anything. This time, it was an occasional victory for Layla.

“How about Hans and Snock?”

“I told you to do it because I wanted to help you.”

“They are good kids.”

“If you are a future warrior, you should have that kind of mindset.”

“By the way, what about you?”

“Why would you do such a troublesome thing if everyone else would take care of it?”

Also, Zich was Zich.

The two arrived at the castle. The gatekeeper who was guarding the gate saw the two and opened the door.

None of the elves already knew them. In particular, there was a mixture of awe and fear in the eyes looking at Zich.

It was shocking to see Zich defeat the fire giant.

Entering the castle, they had a light meal.

Although the castle is now functioning as the headquarters of the Allied Forces, the commanders including the King of the Plains clan were not able to meet because they were outside the castle to take care of the war.

However, not all important personnel went outside.

“Oh, I was here.” Zich, who was biting the bread, and Laila, who was making the soup, looked at the side where the sound was heard at the same time. There was Romane, a shaman of the Lake Clan.

“Can I eat together?”

“Anyway.”

Zich got up and took out Romanne's chair. She thanked Zich and ordered food from the kitchen.

“Is the knife blade okay?”

At her question, Zich and Layla look at each other. And at the same time, he shook his head. Romanne smiled bitterly as if she understood.

“I understand that we have almost given up looking for specific information there. wait please. I don't know how much I can help, but I'll send people to help after the war has been dealt with for a while."

“Ah, thank you.”

There is no room for refusal for humility. Desperately in need of manpower, Laila was grateful for her kindness.

"You're welcome. You are the people who helped the elves of the Great Forest of Adrowon, and you should do that. But, Layla. Could I get some more help'?”

“What help?”

“This time, we decided to move the tears of the lake back to the Mentis.”

“Because of the fire tree.”

Romanne affirmed Zich's words.

"that's right. The king of the plains clan made a formal proposal. Let's move the tears of the lake to Mentis and suppress the runaway of the Fire Tree."

The king of the Plains clan, who served as the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces, was extremely dangerous to the existence of the Fire Tree.

Therefore, he made a proposal to the kings of other clan, and the kings of other clan accepted.

After dinner, Zich and Lila followed Romanne. She took the two of them and led them to the entrance down to the first floor, downstairs.

“I was thinking from the first time I saw it, but was this place originally blocked?”

Zich asked, looking at the entrance to the basement that looked like a stone floor had been removed.

"that's right. It was blocked without a trace. Because I was thinking of making this place completely non-existent. To do that, it's best to make it inconspicuous first. In fact, the other clans forgot about this underworld. The problem was that the ones we should forget the most didn’t forget.”

As if she remembered Renu, she muttered unpleasantly.

“By the way, what did the Iron Clan do?”

“I am in discussion. The king, the elders, and the main force were all completely incapacitated, but there are still many clan left.”

“It will be difficult to deal with.”

"Yes. We can't treat each other as good neighbors like we do now, and we can't just kill them all."

Surprisingly, however, Romanne wasn't too concerned about it.

“Your son will take care of the other kings and take care of them. That's why I'm in the king's seat."

After the great storm of war had passed, politics was no longer a concern for her. She was only faithful to her position as a shaman.

The three went downstairs. The basement wasn't much different from when I had come before. The only difference was that those guarding them were the Allied Forces, not the Iron Clan.

The door with the fire tree was firmly shut. There are currently only two keys that can open the door.

One of them, Renu's key, was burned down. In the sinking corpse of Renu, Zich had seen him.

Naturally, the only key left was Sieg's Windur.

Romanne pulled the lake's tears from her bosom. It was still a mysterious looking gem.

She took it and walked to the center of the basement. When it was brought there, there was an altar made of stone.

I saw that Romanne frowned slightly. Zich understood her feelings.

'A place is a place.'

The altar was located where Renu had installed a brutal altar to drain her blood.

However, Romanne was not a person who was reluctant to work because of her personal feelings. She called Layla to her side.

“Are you going to put the tears of the lake here?”

"that's right."

Layla ripped open the altar. The altar was engraved with several unusual patterns. Her eyes followed the line forming the pattern.

“It’s basically a structure that spreads the magic of the lake’s tears. But what is this? It’s a pretty unusual pattern.”

“Ah, it must be a little unfamiliar to  humans . It's a gin mainly used by our elves. What is the ability... .”

Zich, who had been listening to their conversation, cut off his nerves. The exchange of opinions of the high-ranking wizards was difficult to understand even for Zich, who had accumulated a lot of experience.

He moved towards the wall blocking the room with the fire tree. There was still a large crack in the wall where the key could be inserted.

“Lady.”

“Why?”

Romanne, who was actively exchanging opinions with Layla, looked at Zich.

“Can I open this door?”

When the castle was occupied by the Iron Clan, permission was not required, but now this place is occupied by the Allied Forces. I couldn't open the door recklessly.

"it's okay. Anyway, I was going to ask Mr. Zich a favor.”

"To see if the power of the Lake's Tears can actually contain the Fire Tree."

“I really like people like Mr. Zich because they don’t have to explain everything.”

“It’s impossible because I have a sassy personality, but if I ever step into someone, I’m confident that I’ll be terribly upset.”

Romanne laughed out loud, wondering if Zich's words were funny. Lila, on the other hand, shook her head.

That Zich goes under someone else. I tried to imagine it once in my head, but nothing came to mind.

“Then I will open it.”

Zich thrust Windur into the rift.

shudder! There was the sound of something snapping through the wall.

Zich rotated Windur. Soon the bricks forming the wall fell back and a tree of fire appeared.

“It’s a wonderful tree whenever you look at it.”

Lila, who had come to Zich's side, looked at the fire tree.

The tree of fire was still there. Instead of the leaves, the leaves of the burning flame flicker, and large fire flowers move to and fro near the trunk of the tree.

Romanne also came to their side.

“Fortunately, the only person who can open this wall now is Mr. Zich, so I will be able to let it go for an hour. But that doesn't mean I can't completely relax.”

“Because I can’t guarantee there won’t be another key.”

In fact, Sieg was quite surprised when Renu had the key to open the wall.

"Yes. And I can't guarantee that the owner of the key won't forget it with Renu-like nonsense. The reason why the Iron Clan did not give up their lust for domination from generation to generation is because of the power of this tree.”

Romanne was quite bitter. Even though Renu and the Iron clan started a war as if they wanted to rule over all other clan, they were clearly neighbors until now.

Zich also looked at the Fire Tree.

'After all, I don't know why he betrayed the robes and started the war with his own clan alone.'

Even when wearing a robe and walking around with him, I couldn't ask because he had a consistent attitude of 'I will pay the price for betraying you, and we will hold hands only now'.

"Now that the regression was born before the rumors on Wood Maybe we'll win the war by the cooperation of the lobe guys. In other words, guys ateo not use this wood. "

It was the Iron Clan who knew where the Fire Tree was, how to get to it, and even how to use it. Just because it was before the regression, I didn't think it would be any different.

'There must be a reason. The reason before and after the regression is different.'

However, Renu was dead, and the Fire Tree was only vomiting discontent and discontent.

This time, Zich remembered his sword, Windur.

A sword named after a tree that was said to have supported an ancient empire in mythology. I didn't think much of it when I gave it a name.

It's just a name given because the sword itself looks special and it has a unique look that resembles a branch.

However, after experiencing various experiences, Zich's thinking changed a bit.

'Ancient Empire and Trees.'

I knew the ancient empire called Cloone, and I had already met two special trees in the ruins that seemed to be related to that empire.

'It could be a name that has something to do with it.'

Zich squeezed the handle of Windur he was holding.

Layla helped Romanne install the Lake's Tear Water, which ended successfully.

As the magic of the lake's tears filled the castle, I could see the fire tree's momentum waning. Lo Manne was happy and said that she was really lucky. As the wall closed and the tree of fire disappeared from view, Zich and his party looked at them quietly.

That was the end of what Zich and Layla had to do. After a short chat with Romanne, they were thrown back into the library.

They went back to their dorms after looking for books with text similar to rubbish until late at night.

The hostel was assigned to Zich party sex. Maybe a lot of people who built the most meritorious good atmospheres in this war is the US: assign a hostel.

In the assigned room, Zich was preparing to go to bed, tidying up the blankets and turning his head at the sound of a knock outside the room.

"come in"

It was Layla who came in. Jack smiled and got out of bed.

"what's the matter? Are you trying to seduce me tonight? I am not that easy of a man.”

“Stop talking and sit here.”

Layla sat down at the table in the room and pointed to the other side. Zich sat obediently across from her.

“There is something I want to hear.”

“What do you mean?”

“The reason why you suddenly want to live a good life has changed.”

“Hmm.”

Zich folded his arms and looked at Layla.

“Honestly, if you have already given the answer, I didn’t ask because it didn’t matter what the reason was.

“I take it quite seriously.”

“Think of when you became the Demon King. And how much damage was done as a result. To be honest, I don't think finding a reason is any different from saving the world.”

“The real hero was the girl in front of me.”

Jack laughed.

"Tell me give  can?"

Zich thought for a moment. But it didn't take long.

“It is not difficult. Especially when it comes to you.”

“What if it was me?”

“Because you also know the knowledge of the future.”

“•••Are you talking about the future?”

"okay."

Layla frowned. It seemed to be a more troublesome reason than Lyla herself had expected.

“You know that the memories of the future I know are the memories of the Demon King, right?”

Zich has yet to tell Layla that he has returned.

"know. Personally, I think it's probably because of that memory that your personality leaned towards Siegmore."

“The end of that memory ends with me dying by Gren Genard.”

"•••okay."

Lila wasn't too surprised. The story of the demon king being subjugated by a hero is a story that often appears in children's stories.

But it would be offensive to talk about her own death, so Layla cautiously affirmed.

“Then Gren Jennard said this to me before giving me the final blow. They say, 'The next time you are born, be a good person.'”

“Maybe the reason you do a good deed is… !”

“The words are clearly in my mind.”

Layla opened her mouth. It was strange that Zich, who had a dirty personality, did a good deed, no matter how bad his method was.

But, I guess that's because of what Gren Jennard said in the future.

"Well, I bwae also been in force since eunikka Devil. It scored the matter, but the party was having a party for veterans day knocking down the own tribute. Because of that I had to work a complex. Only way I wrote a own way. "

"I see."

Layla praised Glenn Gennard from the bottom of her heart. Whatever the situation, what Gren Jennard would say in the future was definitely stopping Jig from becoming the Demon King.

'It deserves to be called a warrior.'

But Layla soon had to completely deny her assessment.

“But that Gurren Gennard is suspicious.”

“Are you in doubt?”

Zich told Layla his guess. The more he listened, the more astonished Laila's face grew.

“Come on, wait! Your words... !”

" right."

Zich said with a cold smile.

“Gren Jennard. GNOME is not the warrior we know the hypocrites, it's likely to be more garbage imagination. "

(Continued on next page)

No. 222 screen

“You’re a hypocrite… .”

Her voice trembled thinly. The fact that Gren Jennerd, who he thought was a hero like a stone, might have a different mind, was something that even Laila could not have imagined.

"for a moment! I was also asked if I could think of another future for Gren Jennard at that time!”

"Haeseoya in order to ensure that the future is hypocritical mask of Glenn De stripped Zener there."

Lila swallowed her saliva. If Zich's suspicions are true, the whole world will be deceived by a hypocrite in the future.

“If I’m right, the person who created a lot of demons and created chaos in the world would be that Ren Gennard. Do I need to listen to what he has to say?”

Lila couldn't answer.

"No, it's fine by them. You should be all right but the world deceived me up seonja not have to be a guy comes out better by heat. Now I am become a devil figure has stirred the world. But the problem is that you'll likely have a GNOME created the Devil Siegfried Mohr strength. "

Jack smiled faintly. At that smile, Lila felt goosebumps welling up on her back.

"I'm not so good with him so indulgent to forgive him rice in my life."

Lila swallowed her saliva. The situation was more serious than expected.

'Zeek at least never moved with grudges.'

Even with sparsely punctured memories, the Demon King of Power Siegmore was such a person.

Of course, he sprinkled blood and slaughter so much that he was called the Demon King, and his hands were cruel as he had half a personality. And as much as he likes to fuck people, he doesn't show mercy to his enemies.

But Siegmore was basically a person who only wanted power. His evil deeds also occurred when he collided with other people or forces, basically seeking power.

There were times when he moved for minor quarrels, but that was only for a brief moment, and it was far from the basic behavior of Zich.

'By the way, if Zich moves to solve his grudge... .'

No matter how good I thought of it, I could only imagine something worse than that of Siegmore.

If Zich starts moving for the purpose of resentment, it is unlikely that he will seek revenge by pinpointing the one who has a grudge without harming others.

'I'll have to find another reason really quickly!'

Layla became more urgent.


It was an island. Long ago, the island sprouted out of the sea by a volcanic eruption and was still undergoing intense volcanic activity.

Red lava flowed over the caldera at the top of the mountain towering in the center of the island.

When the volcanic activity intensified, the lava scattered its presence high in the sky. At that time, volcanic ash erupted into the sky and filled the surroundings.

Since it was an island with such a harsh environment, there was not much movement of life. At best, there were only grasses thinly covering the island and seabirds flying in the sky.

It is a useless island that is far from the mainland, has no drinking water, and has a rough topography, making it difficult for even sailors to stop by.

However, human movement was detected there.

At the foot of the volcano, there was an entrance to a cave large enough for one person to fit in.

It looks like a natural cave, and it is curved and slanted downhill.

A was formed. It was definitely not a human-friendly cave.

As you make your way down the cave, which is quite deep, you start to notice a surprisingly artificial smell. The aisles were flattened and even stairs were made.

If you go further in that state, you will arrive in front of a large door.

It looked like a hideout of a secret society plotting something nasty.

A group of people could be seen beyond the door. There was no sunlight, and only a lot of torches and candles placed on the walls and floor lit up the space, but most of the people there were wearing robes.

Perhaps if Zich had seen this place, he would have been ecstatic. He must have swung Windur here and there, saying that he had finally found one of the hideouts of those who had flipped the robes.

But fortunately for those in the robes, Zich was not here.

There were not only people in robes in the space. There was also a man presumed to be in command of those wearing robes.

He sat in a large chair as if he were a king.

The surrounding area was not glamorous enough to be considered the residence of the king. Rather, it was not enough to be sarcastic. The throne-like chair disturbed the balance with its surroundings and looked rather vulgar.

But the man didn't care. It was a sight that clearly showed the character of the man.

“Did you find the cause?”

said the man displeased. It was clear that there was something he didn't like. Those in robes bowed their heads. There was no answer.

“This is the second time.” The displeasure in the man's voice deepened even more, and the heads of those wearing robes went down with him.

The man grinded his teeth. But there were no further questions. Chilly eyes glanced over those in the robes.

“••• Find the core somehow. There may be a clue in her memory.”

—net j —

Those in robes answered all at once and hurriedly left the space. They didn't want to be with an uncomfortable boss, just like everyone else.

As the men disappeared, the man hung down on the chair. sighed.

'Nothing really happened.'

It is a moment to think while pressing your head with your fingers. He got up from his chair.

The space he was in was quite large. There was not a single pillar, so I wondered how it would collapse.

But more surprising than that was the condition of the space.

It was by no means a natural cave. The walls and floors were straight as if they had been meticulously chiseled out, and there were a variety of useless devices everywhere.

And strange patterns were engraved on the floor, wall, and ceiling, and a silver light was scattering.

The man got up from his seat. I trudged to one side of the space. His footsteps stopped in front of a device.

It looked like a cylinder large enough for one person to fit in. It was surrounded by a transparent round wall, so that the inside was clearly visible. But now the transparent wall was cracked and broken.

As if something had escaped from within.

The man, who had been staring at the cylinder, moved again.

The escaped core is also a problem, but what's giving him a headache now was something else.

Unlike a space that maintains a perfectly straight shape, one wall was open as if it had collapsed. The man stopped walking through the hole in the wall.

It was a wonderful place. Red lava flowing down the wall scatters fierce light. They gathered at the bottom to form a large lake of lava. Just by feeling the faint heat, I could see how intensely hot the lava was.

But what was really surprising was not the lake of lava.

There was a large island in the center of the lake. The lava lake was flowing as if escorting or encircling the island.

A tree stood on the island.

The tree had no special features. There were also green leaves on the brown surface.

Even though it was a very special tree just because it was taking root underground where lava flows, the appearance was not different from other common trees.

it was just great whopping. Surprisingly.

The distance from where the man was to where the lava lake was, with a little exaggeration, was as far as the bottom and top of a great mountain.

The branch of the tree, which had taken root in the lava lake, stretched to the surprise of the man.

However, if you look closely, the appearance of the tree also looked awkward. Branches extending over the body were not regular.

A few places were large and empty, as if someone had cut them.

The man looked at the tree. It was as if they were trying to dig out the intention of a tree.

But the tree had neither expression nor gesture. just being quiet

The man shook his head.

The incident happened a while ago. A tree that had quietly taken root and only existed here suddenly vibrated. The vibration was so great that I thought that the volcano on the island might explode at any moment.

But there was no such thing. The violent vibrations of the trees were funny, and nothing happened outside. The subordinate who was outside said that he did not feel the vibration.

I was startled by the first vibration of the tree, but it didn't end with one. Just a few days ago, the vibration occurred again.

The man asked his subordinates to investigate the cause, but he did not expect much. And again, the subordinates could not find out the cause.

They did not know the exact principle and structure of the system. just using it

The man looked at the broken cylinder once more, sighed, and turned his gaze back to the tree.

The man put the name of the tree in his mouth.

“Windur.”

It's the only tree you know. I've done some research, but haven't found anything. I was hesitant to investigate in detail because I was afraid that the system would be damaged if I accidentally touched it.

But one thing was certain: this tree had a huge impact on the system.

Therefore, the man had no choice but to react hysterically to the abnormality of the tree.

He stared at the tree and sighed quietly.

“I had never been like this before.”

Zich had a dream. During the dream, Zich knew it was a dream.

It was a lucid dream.

However, the moment he saw the contents of the dream, he lifted the crane. I wanted to get out of this dream right now.

“I had a hard time today.”

A man with a good smile looking at his party. it was himself

'No, not me.'

Zich shook his head hastily. You are right, but you are not yourself.

The person who appeared in the dream was the Zich Brave. As Layla said, he was called Zich's Future of Heroes.

I wanted to wake up right away, but it was not easy to wake up from this damn dream. I waved my arms, shouted and kicked, but the dream still continued.

In the end, Zich had no choice but to watch the progress of his dream with his arms crossed and a fat expression on his face.

Zich Brave was still nice. Zich saw Brave's actions and was shivered. He shook his head and spit.

'Damn you. Acting like a good person.'

Zich didn't really care whether others acted like a good person or not, but Brave was different.

Seeing a man with the same face as him, spit out cocky words one after another, he suffered even more murder than Gren Jennard.

It didn't seem that cool to blow that guy's neck off with Windur.

The couple talked a lot. It was a small talk.

However, after Leona received a note from a bird, the mood changed.

"What? What are you talking about with such a serious face?”

asked the old wizard. They usually quarrel, but neither of them really hated each other. Leona's face hardened, and she was worried.

“… The Demon King has moved again.”

At Leona's words, the faces of others hardened.

(Continued on next page)

No. 223 screen

' Devil?'

For the first time, a feeling of interest appeared in Zich's eyes, who had been watching Brave's conversation with a cold expression on his face.

'By the way, did you say that the guy named Zich Brave was a hero?'

He wouldn't give him the title of a hero just because he had some skills with Estelaide. Even Gren Jennard was called a hero from the time he declared his attack on the Demon King in earnest after killing several demons.

'Then at least that guy is saying that there was something hostile to humans enough to receive the title of hero.'

There is still no certainty that the dream of a dog in front of us is real. However, as Layla remembered Zich Brave as a hero, Zich's conjecture was convincing.

'Then who  ?'

The future where the Demon King of Power Sieg More became the hero Zich Brave, of course, the opponent would not be Sieg himself.

'Are they other demon lords?' Considering the pre-regression, it was highly probable. However, it was not possible to make hasty decisions.

'It's a crazy world where I'm called a hero, so a completely different future may unfold.'

do you know It may be the world where Saint Aine Rubella reigns as the Demon King.

'… That's just awful.'

Zich shook his head to disperse his thoughts, then listened to Brave and the others again.

Zich Brave asked.

“Where did you go?”

“Suitall.”

“A big city.”

Geohan drooled and then asked.

“How do you say it happened?”

“It has been captured.”

“•••The damage must not be too much.”

“It is written that they were annihilated.”

At Leona's words, the group all closed their mouths at once.

the annihilation of large cities. I don't know the details of the situation, but no matter how well I try to interpret it, only terrible images come to mind.

“… dead… No, how many people have survived?”

asked the wizard. If the demon king invaded and the city fell, it would be faster to count the living than the dead.

“It’s not written.”

“Nearly or none at all. It must be one of the two.”

After the wizard's words, silence fell again.

“•••I can't forgive you!”

Rubella exclaimed. Anger, an emotion that did not go well with her, appeared on her face, who was always serving others with a pure face.

“Stull is a very peaceful city! The citizens were friendly and the mayor was a nice person too! It was a city that Karna-sama believed in faithfully... ! that... ! that... !”

In the end, Rubella could not continue to speak and shook her head. Quietly flowing tears wet the floor little by little. Leona patted her on the back.

“Aine is right.”

Zich Brave said. All eyes of the group were focused on him. Zich Brave's voice wasn't as intense as Rubella's. But no one thought that he would feel at peace.

Sometimes quiet anger is even scarier.

“There must have been bad people. There must have been people who could not be forgiven. But there must have been far more people who quietly did their jobs and lived a good life!”

Zich Brave clenched his fists.

“There is absolutely no reason for them to die that way!”

'Wow, is that really me?'

Zich scratched his arm.

'Please .  When will this bastard's nightmare end  ?'

The dream he is dreaming of now was the most cruel nightmare for Zich. It felt as if fear was rising from the depths of the depths.

Zich Brave looked at Leona.

“Are you saying that the Demon King is still in Suitol?”

"no. It says that he has withdrawn now.”

“You don’t know where you went?”

“There is no such information.”

Zich Brave thought for a moment.

“First, let’s go to Suitol. Let's find out where the Demon King has gone. If you can get the Demon King's information, you'll get it."

The group all nodded their heads. It was a decision made by their leader, Zich Brave. Moreover, there was no reason to oppose it.

“Then let’s start with the information about the Demon King we know first, shall we?”

The wizard made an opinion.

“… But we know very little.”

The giant expressed his doubts.

“Well, yes. But if even a few pieces of information are important, it's good to keep reminding them. It will be etched into your mind so clearly, and when you find something relevant, you will be able to relate it more easily.”

“That’s right.”

The giant nodded.

“Let me tell you first.”

said the wizard.

“As you know, he has tremendous magical powers. He has enormous magical powers as well as his magical skills. In addition to being proficient in double chanting without singing, the magic power is excellent even when singing without singing. It goes without saying that if we do a formal chanting.”

“And deal with monsters. This guy's strength is really great. Water quality is overwhelming. Even a few fortresses that are said to be impregnable have been captured.”

Leona got the word. Next, the giant opened his mouth.

“Appearance is no different from that of a human being. Gender Star looks female, but I don't know. It's just the outside appearance, and it's questionable whether he's a human or not."

“And it’s beautiful. very much People around me say that I am beautiful too, but the Demon King is a beauty that far surpasses me.”

The ending was Rubella. In a way, it seemed to compliment the demon king's appearance, but seeing her exhaling a chilly chill, it was clear that she was merely exuding the demon king's characteristics.

Zich Brave nodded. It was no different from what he knew.

“I know everything. Please remember that information. And if you find any information that might be related to information you know, please take a closer look.”

The companions nodded their heads.

“Then let’s go to sleep. I'll have to get up early tomorrow and go to Suitol."

With those words, Zich Brave and his party quickly went to bed, leaving behind the invisible giant.

And Zich's vision was distorted.

flash!

Jack opened his eyes. I stood up and looked around. It looked like a spacious, well-organized room. It was one of the rooms in Mentis Castle assigned to him. It hasn't changed at all from what it was before I fell asleep.

Zich turned his head and looked out the window. The darkness had not yet subsided, but the light of the sun was slowly spreading over the ridge.

dump!

Zich lay back on the bed. Then I started thinking about my dreams.

'Dog dream... I wish it was.'

However, Sieg already had doubts that his dream might not be just a dog's dream.

If the current dream is a dog dream, spit once and spit once, saying, 'It's like a nightmare Brave!' and it's over.

But what if the dream of today was one of the possibilities of the future?

is different

'You are the Demon King.'

Zich recalled the existence of the Demon King who appeared in his dream.

'Once I consider the information that Brave's colleagues have told me, I am not the Demon Lord I know.'

Although his abilities are close to that of the Demon King of Magic, he is not a woman, and even more not a beauty.

However, it was not without a point. No, it was a problem because there were people who pointed out too much.

An excellent wizard who can freely handle double chants and no chants, and can use magic with no chants to produce great power, and can shoot great magic when performing formal chants.

In addition, the condition of being a beautiful woman surpassing even Rubella.

'It's just Lila.'

It even feels like I've seen and evaluated the person named Laila.

'If it's really Layla and I'm the Demon King of the Brave days... .'

Zich's brow furrowed.

'Did he cheat on me?'

But it seemed unlikely. Layla's actions were just a knowledgeable countryman. Besides, his skills weren't even enough to be called the Demon King.

Of course, as time passed, she was sure to reach the level of ability to be called a Demon King just like Zich.

'Or have I lost the memories of when I was a Demon King?'

I thought a lot about it, but of course nothing came to light.

'A dream may be a dog's dream.'

But it's also true that it bothers me.

'It would be nice to have a little more interest in Layla.'

But I imagined what would happen if that guy was really the Demon King.

'Is that guy the Demon King?'

I remembered her face, who was desperately trying to somehow get her out of the way of the Demon King. Such a guy is the devil.

'For now, Hans and Snock will be hostile of course.'

And they will probably be very heartbroken, if not as much as when Zich himself became the Demon King.

'Even with me... They probably won't be able to stay on good terms.'

If Zich puts good deeds before him, of course, he will clash with Layla. Because Zich himself, who does good deeds, and the Demon King are incompatible beings.

'It's the same even if I walk the path of the Demon King again.'

Even before the return, he had never had a good relationship with other Demon Lords. Rather, they often collided.

Considering that, even with Laila, who became the Demon King, there was a high possibility that they would clash rather than get along with each other.

'One way or another, there must be only a fight.'

Zich looked out the window.

'… This is definitely surprising.'

Zich sympathized with the emotions he was feeling right now.

'Bitter. This is definitely bittersweet.'

The thought of having a fight with Laila makes you feel this way.

'Maybe it's because the situation is different from the past.'

If he chooses to become the Demon King, he will become hostile to Layla, Hans, and Snock. However, it was a decision that contained Zich's will to the end.

However, if Layla becomes the Demon King, there is a high possibility that she will become hostile to her regardless of Zich's will.

Perhaps it is because of this feeling.

When Zich realized that, he laughed.

'I thought I was doing a good deed just because of Gren Jennerd, but apparently I have changed quite a bit.'

The self I am now is at least a completely different being than that of Siegmore before the return.

Jack got up from the bed.

'Well, okay.'

walked to the window The light over the ridge grew stronger and the full-fledged ripples of the sun began to appear.

'I don't care if that's the real future or not. It would be impossible to go to the futures I know and see now anyway.'

So much of the past has already changed. Perhaps even if Zich or Laila walk the path of the Demon King, the future will never be the same as it was then.

'No one knows what will happen to me, what will become of Layla, what will become of Hans, Snock and Gren Gennard.'

Knowing the future was impossible even for the Demon King of Power, Siegmore.

'But anyway, I decide which way I will go.'

Whether the end was glory or ruin, it was important that Zich himself chose it.

'Whether to be swayed by emotions or shake off emotions, whether to walk the path of a warrior or a demon king, be hostile to the current colleagues or remain as colleagues, it is up to me to decide.' In this way, the future will be born when each other's choices and choices are intertwined. And no one knows the future.

'Don't worry too much. I have some interest in Layla, but I don't need this award.'

You just need to find the right information. Not worrying about it and letting go of it altogether are two completely different things.

Before long, the sun had crossed the ridge and scattered its splendid body to every corner of the earth.

Zich looked at the sun for a moment and then turned around.

Cheeky!

thud!

The sound of the door closing was heard, and only household items and bright sunlight from the window remained in the room.

Zich companions found the same book will be continuously associated with the ancient empire in the book pipe while.

Shortly thereafter, the manpower sent by the Allied Forces arrived.

Layla handed them rubbish-coated papers and asked them to find letters similar to this one.

The manpower sent by the Allied Forces was quite large. They walked through the books with manuscripts. The missing manuscripts were written by other elves and handed over to those who didn't have copies.

The work proceeded very quickly, but it was not easy.

Pussack!

Zich frowned and looked at the scraps of shattered books that remained in his hands.

It wasn't a strong force. I just held it lightly, and the book poured out debris like a withered leaf.

No matter how well the library is maintained, the strong force of time has too easily neutralized artificial management.

“Twitch!”

With one bite, Zich tossed the book into a nearby trash can. Already in the trash can were piles of broken and unrecognizable books.

I went back to where I was before and this time I took out another book. Fortunately, this book was in good condition.

If handled carelessly, it might turn into dust like the previous book, but it did not cause a catastrophic collapse just by holding it.

Zich opened the book and looked at the letters.

'I don't think this guy is either'

Layla's rubbing and handwriting were different. Zich put the book aside and looked for another one.

“Were you here?”

I looked over the wall made of books. Her vision was obscured, but she could see clear eyes and waving hair through the piles of books.

It was Layla.

While looking for books, it seemed that Laila had come to the area where she was looking for books.

Zich stared at Laila.

'This guy could be the Demon King.'

She is a candidate for the Demon King, who hates Zich himself becoming the Demon King. It is also a demon king who opposes Zich when he was a warrior wielding Estelaide.

“… Why are you looking at me?”

Layla asked if she noticed Zich's meaningful gaze.

“••• Do you have any dissatisfaction with the world?”

"what?"

The book she was holding fluttered. Grasping the book she had almost dropped, she stared at Zich thinly.

“What kind of bullshit all of a sudden.”

“Or do you have any kind of idea that you should not choose any means and methods for an end?”

“I am you!”

If Zich had been nearby, he would have shaved one of his shin teeth. Layla glared at Zich one more time and then walked away.

“Find a book in your nonsense time.”

Layla seems to have accepted Zich's teasing as always. Zich scratched his head.

'That guy is the devil.'

Is it also a dream?

'Nope. Like I thought last time, there may be something in the lost memory, and you never know when a person will change.'

Anyone who knew Sieg Steelwall as a child could have imagined the Siegmore of the future. That's how much people's future was unknown.

But beyond that, Zich didn't try to dig up anything from Layla. My mind has already been cleared.

He again walked towards the other pile to find books related to the ancient empire.

A certain amount of time has passed even after arriving at the Adrowon Great Forest. After the war ended, the time had come for Zich and his party to leave, who were living in Mentis and researching books in the library.

"Gonna miss you!"

Leona hugged Zich and Layla with tears in their eyes. Layla pats her on the back. Zich also tapped her on the shoulder once.

Leona did not follow Zich's party.

The reason she left her clan and ran away in the first place was because the tears of the lake were stolen. As long as the tears of the lake have returned to the bosom of the clan, there is no reason for her to leave the forest.

Of course, she didn't think it was a bad idea to continue traveling with Zich in this state. However, the price of the name of the next great shaman candidate made her hesitant.

This is because, until now, the status of a shaman, who had only been a privileged elder who performed the ancestral rites of the lake clan, has risen sharply due to the unexpected existence of the fire tree.

As such, the position of the successor of the shaman became important.

If it was like before, it would have bounced once. He wouldn't have refused outright, but he would have given him a lot of hate.

Because she was a very young girl as an elf.

But what she saw, heard and experienced as she went out into the human world changed her.

Leona decided to take on the position of the shaman's successor.

Because of that, I couldn't go with Zich's group.

Leona hugged Hans and Snock once, and hugged Knowwet tightly once.

and backed off He smiled brightly with dewdrops in his eyes.

“Even though we break up now, this won’t be the last time we see each other.”

"Sure. I plan to use a knife blade often, so at least I can see it every now and then.”

Layla responded.

“Do you always stop by me every time you come? It must be!”

"Sure!"

Leona, who had received the confirmation from Laila, looked at Zich this time.

“Growing up?”

Leona looks at her with a little anxious eyes. Jack nodded his head.

If you think about it, the relationship between Zich and Leona was very strange.

Leona, who, along with Gren Jennerd, helped kill Zich. But to be honest, Zich had absolutely no grudges against him.

'You should just keep your mouth shut. Besides, it's different from Leona since I've already collaborated with Rubella.'

But he didn't have a good image either. It wasn't unusual to come out in his dream, but that's it.

But now, Zich clearly recognized her as the same party.

'It's not difficult to illuminate your face when you have a chance to stop by.'

So I was able to give you a pretty cool answer.

Of course, the pressure of Layla, who always nodded her head and looked at her with her eyes wide open, was definitely one of the reasons.

"thanks!"

Leona said loudly. Then he retreated to the side of the family behind him.

They came out to see off Zich and others, and they were watching Leona's farewell scene calmly.

The queen hugs Leona's shoulder and wipes away her tears. Romanne also stroked Leona's head.

The only ones out there were the Royal Family of the Lake Clan. All of the other clan kings finished greetings the day before.

This seat was made separately by Leona, Zich's friend, and his family.

The king took a step forward.

“We would like to thank you again for helping us.”

"You're welcome. We have gained quite a bit.”

Jack replied. Information of the ancient empire or the tree of fire. This trip was definitely fruitful.

“Besides, he even let me take Calfnal’s book.”

Thanks to the efforts of Zich, Layla, and supported Allied forces, they were able to find a significant amount of books with rubbish-like text.

But, of course, I didn't know what the book was about. I can't even copy that much. Even though I was transcribed, I didn't know how to write the wrong meaning because I didn't know the letters.

Even so, he couldn't just sit down on the mentis and detoxify.

Recognizing the difficulties of Zich and his party, the elves of the Great Forest of Drawwon made a decision and decided to lend all the books they found.

It was quite surprising. As Leona's older brother said in the past, the books in the Calfnal are treated as elven treasures.

But are you willing to lend me those things? It was a clear indication of how grateful the elves of Adrowon Great Forest were for Sieg and the others.

“If you need more, come anytime. Because I've already finished talking to the kings of the other clan. Even if you come with all the books you've borrowed damaged, I'll lend you another book."

"thank you."

Zich's group also greeted others. Romanne was also very sad to part with them, especially Layla.

When drawing out the magical power of the lake's tears, it moves with his back and shows a lot of affection.

“If there is anything difficult, I ask for help right away. Even if the other clan refuses, our lake clan will help you.”

She said caringly with the eyes of a grandmother looking at her grandchildren.

After saying good-bye, Zich and the group left. As when they came to the capital of the lake clan, Deniel guided them.

As a result of this war, Deniel returned to the Royal Guard. However, this time alone, he decided to guide Zich and his party to the last border of the lake clan. Lake's clan was a visible favor, and Deniel volunteered for this mission.

“Let’s go.”

Deniel takes the lead, and Zich and others follow.

So, Zich and his group went on their way to leaving the Adrowon Great Forest.

After arriving at the last village of the lake clan, Zich and his party parted ways with Deniel. Now all that was left was them.

“It’s a little empty.”

Lila glanced to the side. The place that had always been Leona's seat was now empty.

Even though it hasn't been a while since we've met, it seems like they've already become very fond of each other.

'If it's Lila, of course.'

To Laila, who has no memory, Leona is one of the top five close friends. It was unavoidable that she, who was rich in emotions, suffered greatly from loneliness.

'Is that kind of guy going to become a Demon King?'

Even though I knew that people can change enough, I kept thinking about it.

Shaking her tears away, Lila asked Zich.

“What happened to the Iron Clan?”

“Once the other clan manages it, it looks like it will be compensated for the damage.”

“Ordinary elves are pitiful. Those elves would have nothing to do with Renu or the ruling class.”

In the distant past, ordinary elves of the Iron Clan may have persecuted other clan, but it was difficult to ask the current Iron Clan about the cause.

“If only Renu had been quiet, it would have been peaceful. Well, it seems that other clans are not going to do anything harsh to the general elves of the Iron clan.”

“That’s good.”

Layla was relieved.

“Then where are you going now?”

"Well."

'Shall we go to Suitall?'

It is the place where the demon king, who came out of a dream, probably Ryline, fell.

'I think it would be good to visit once.'

At that moment, Layla broke Zich's thoughts.

“If it’s okay, can I go to 'Sunweek'?”

“Sunuwick?”

It's a city that Zich knows. No, it's a very famous city beyond what I know. A city that even Hans and Snock know nothing about the city of the world.

“Yeah, I was wondering if there might be information about Cloone there. I might be able to get some help with the interpretation of the book I brought with me.”

“Certainly not.”

Sunnwick is a city famous for all kinds of knowledge and learning. But they don't mean much compared to anything else in the city.

“Because, after all, there is a horse tower.'

A holy place for all wizards in the world. That was the nickname Sunuwick was most often called by people.

(Continued on next page)

No. 225 screen

Snoowick.

As mentioned by Sieg in the past, the city is even called the sanctuary of wizards. Even the wizards, who were said to be rare, were quite common here.

There were wizards who carried wands or wore robes and looked like 'I'm a wizard', as well as wizards who wandered around like ordinary people with no other characteristics.

However, there was one thing in common with the city wizards.

A small brooch on the left chest. As much as that brooch that tells them that he belongs to the Magic Tower, no matter what kind of outfit he wore, any wizard would always wear it.

That was the pride of being a member of the mato.

There were many places to raise wizards other than Snoowick.

There are places in the country that operate a training center for wizards, while others, like Snouwick, build a horse tower and operate the entire city as a wizard training school.

However, when no one asked about the city of the tower and the holy land of sorcerers, no other name was given.

Snoowick.

Those were the only words that came out of people's mouths.

As if to speak of Snuwick's reputation, in the center of the city stood a tower that stood high as if piercing the sky.

The fact that he reveals his majesty even in places where the city cannot be seen was enough to embody something that never collapses.

The honor and pride of the wizards in Snoowick. Despite the envy, jealousy, and restraints of all wizards around the world, a giant tree that does not waver.

That was Snuwick's horse tower.

Naturally, those who visited Snuwick for the first time admired the tower even before entering the city.

"Oh oh!"

"Wow!"

And it was the same with Hans, who had never come out of Count, and Snock, who lived in the mines.

“That’s a horse tower!”

“Really high!”

coup!

Two and one bowed their heads as if they were falling. No Webb, who stood on Snock's shoulder and looked up at the horse tower, lost his balance for an instant and fell backwards.

Fortunately, Nowet was able to prevent the disaster from crashing to the floor by grabbing Snock's hem with his reflexes and hanging it for a long time.

Layla looked up at the tower. Contrary to the feelings of Hans and Snock, who simply looked at something strange, her eyes were sparkling with interest.

It is the most wizard-friendly city in the world. As a magician, she had to be very happy.

There is knowledge of this city, but knowledge and experience are completely different laws. The experience she will experience here is something she was looking forward to.

and Jack. He looked up at the tower like everyone else. However, his emotions had a completely different direction from those of the other three-some four.

'Damn bastards.' Before the return where he was fighting against everyone. There is no way that Zich, who has been fighting against any large force, has not faced Snuwick's Magic Tower.

Of course, I stuck with it and struggled.

Wizards who are weak in close combat and have a slow attack speed. However, the reason wizards are respected is that they are capable of hitting a huge 'one shot' if they compensate for their weaknesses.

Moreover, as the number of wizards increased, there were many ways to amplify their power.

Such as using larger magic by connecting each other's magical powers, or using magic that creates a synergistic effect that makes 2 or more instead of 1 + 1 = 2 .

The great magic that raged from all directions almost killed Zich as well.

Of course, Zich eventually broke through the magic storm and slaughtered the wizards. But before approaching the wizards, it really felt like a ticket to hell was clenched in my hands.

But in any case, the final victory was his.

'If the link between them was a little better, it would have been much more difficult.'

They are smart guys, so even though they have good strategies and tactics, it was clumsy to lead those who stood as soldiers on the battlefield. Zich effectively pierced the gap.

Zich shook off his thoughts. And with their own feelings, they brought out the companions who were looking at the horse tower and Snoowick in their appreciation.

“Calm down, you guys. It is a nuisance to people if you stand in front of the city gate and lose yourself in it.”

“•••Are you saying you are a nuisance?” Layla was absurd.

"Why? At least now, I am a good person who does not cause trouble to others. Did you know that Carwiman gave you an honorary genitalia as a token of that?”

“Aren’t you in trouble? If you hear of these people who have been humiliated and humiliated and run for their lives, they will probably try to get up with their body parts glued together somehow, whether they have been cut, destroyed, or rotted?”

“You don’t know, Layla.”

Zich wrinkled one eye.

“Bad guys are like practice targets who can do anything whether they paddle, trample, or spit. No matter what you do to them, people praise them. But what trouble am I going to cause?”

“People who have been victimized certainly don’t think that way.”

“They have no right to make such an expression. Because they are bad guys.”

"•••You know it's funny to say things like that, right?"

“No, not at all. I've had this idea for a long time. Even if I listened to my story now, I would nod my head saying that this story is a hundred times right?”

“Anyway, the snout!”

As if she couldn't hear any more, Layla shook her head and stepped forward.

Zich followed her with a playful smile, and Hans and Snock moved.

So they set foot in Snoowick in earnest.

For a moment, Laila roamed the whole city, even though her mood was subdued by the sophistry, not the sophistication of Zich.

To the wizard, this city was like heaven.

There were shops selling all kinds of magical items and materials, and there were also places that sold magic books, even though they were of low power.

Moreover, since it was a place where magicians with a high passion for learning gathered, the overall volume and quality of books were also high.

So now, Zich, Hans, and Snock were being dragged around by her without even finding a place to stay.

“Oh, look at that! Was there anything like that here?”

Leaving those words alone, Lila left the group and went to a stall.

“•••It is usually said that animals separated from the herd are vulnerable to external threats.”

However, the current Layla seemed to be able to reverse bite and kill any formidable predator.

Zich's group sneakily approached Layla's place. I stood at some distance. It was a distance that could barely be recognized as her and her party.

“Is this an artifact that can shoot wind arrows?”

“You have very good eyesight, Miss. You see the use right away.”

The owner of the store was a middle-aged man who didn't look special. However, seeing the brooch symbolizing the horse tower on his left chest, he seemed to be a wizard who came out to sell his invention to earn research funds.

What Layla held in her hand was a thin gold plate. A thin magical energy flows through the intricately intertwined Jin on the surface.

" how much is it?"

Interesting. There is money too. Layla asked the price at once.

The wizard said the price. Hans and Snock were astonished.

“I mean, is it that expensive?”

“Isn’t that a rip off?”

Although the two received quite a lot of money from Zich, they still had a common sense.

Even if you had money in the first place, you didn't get used to it because there wasn't much time to use it comfortably.

“The original artifacts are like that.”

Zich corrects the misunderstanding between Hans and Snock.

“It may be hard for you guys to realize it because Layla made a lot of artifacts while traveling, but artifacts are extremely difficult to make. It is an item that a high-level wizard with precious materials should invest time in and make with great care in a well-equipped workshop. Of course, even the smallest artifacts will inevitably become expensive. At that price, it’s not very expensive, but rather cheap artifacts.”

Of course, there are often times when they sell with a bit of a rip-off as much as the market, but in Zich's view, this transaction was fairly fair.

'I guess either the merchant was honest, or he decided that Lyla wasn't the kind of person who could cheat. There aren't many wizards who only look at the magic circle and figure out the purpose.'

And Zich saw that the latter probably accounted for most of the reasons.

Layla happily returned to her party with the artifact.

“You look good. Isn't it great stuff?"

“No, it’s garbage.”

Zich sprained his foot. Hans and Snok also looked at Layla.

“The drive and manifestation of magic are outdated and outdated, and the movement of magic moves back and forth and is incredibly inefficient. There is no such thing as power amplification. Of course, the power, range, and mana consumption are all low-level. The thought of selling such garbage really hurts the courage of that person.”

Hans and Snock looked at each other. Someone came to mind from Layla's tone. Naturally, I saw the main character.

“•••What are you looking at like that? not me It's not because of me!"

However, Zich's denial did not work. Now, even now, I looked at Zich.

“Damn it, then why did you buy it?”

Jack was annoyed.

“It was so messed up that I was rather curious. For some reason, it's amazing when a thing made of garbage, no matter how trivial, moves. So I bought it. On the contrary, I don’t know if this will help me more.”

“••• Is that so?”

Jack looked back. The wizard who sold the goods to Laila was looking at Zich's party with joy. He noticed Zich's gaze and greeted him with his eyes.

No matter how much Zekra, he could not ignore the greeting and greeted with the same eyes. Then he turned his head and looked forward.

Zich never visited the store again.

“•••Now let's get some lodging.”

When Zich spoke those words to Laila, it was when the sky slowly began to turn yellow.

Layla looked up at the sky and was surprised. She didn't know that time would pass like this.

"great. Let’s just look at the shops on this line and go catch them.”

“••• Usually there should be talk of finding accommodation right there, right?”

But Layla was already looking at the goods from a nearby store.

Zich sighed and counted the other stores in the store line that Layla had entered.

'I'm glad I don't have much.'

It was a fairly sparsely populated place. As I wandered through the city at random, I came to this place. Of course, the number of stores was also small.

Zich looked over the product over Layla's shoulder. As it is located in a sparsely populated area, of course, the condition of the store products seemed to deteriorate. Even in Zich's eyes, the products were crude.

'I think this is more interesting to Layla.'

However, Layra was also of low quality and did not purchase it haphazardly.

'I said that it is necessary to distinguish between garbage that is interesting and garbage full of odors.' Of course, that standard was Leila's own.

Layla, who was moving while scanning the items in the store, finally arrived at the last store. When this is finally over, Zich stood behind her, thinking that she could find a place to stay.

"welcome."

beauty welcomes them Zich looked at the merchandise.

' Huh?'

Zich tilted his head.

'I don't think these are artifacts?'

Artifact's unique magic is not felt. If so, is it an artifact that can hide even magical power?

'Why are you selling such things on the street?'

Zich looked at the owner of the store. and opened his eyes wide.

'This guy!'

someone you know No, it would be more accurate to say that he was an unforgettable person.

A robe that looked like it was picked up and worn with brittle brown hair. But green eyes sparkle with guns. A woman who is not dressed up, but can hear the sound of a beautiful woman just by being exposed.

'Helena Dwayne!'

Before returning, there was a wizard from the Hero Party who defeated him with Gren Jennerd.
