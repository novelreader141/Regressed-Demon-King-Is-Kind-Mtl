lush recording. The sound of grass bugs everywhere. The sound of leaves rustling in the wind and the faint smell of earth rising up.

If you look at the expression, it is like a scene of a cozy forest that soothes and soothes people's minds and bodies.

However, the place where Zich and his friends are walking now is a place that fits that image, but it is by no means the forest that people think it is.

At least for Lyla.

"Oh!"

Lyla must have been quietly buried in her thoughts, but without realizing it, her foot got caught in the root of the tree that extended outward once more.

Her body leaned forward.

“Ouch!”

But she never flew to the ground like an idiot. Zich, who was walking in front, took her body lightly.

"thanks."

“Say nothing, Lady.”

A smirk, a jingle remark, and even a wink once. After one light prank, Zich put Lyla upright.

Lyla sighed. How many times is this already? It was the second to hit the root, and there were too many other traps here.

A hole hidden in a bush, a creek full of slippery mud, or a mossy stone.

Lyla looked around again. All you can see is a thick forest and a large tree. I can't even get a good view.

Plants that bring various benefits to humans, such as food and wood, were completely hostile to humans here.

Adrowon Great Forest.

It was the name of the forest they were walking in.

The beginning was Zich's decision to make his next destination Leona's hometown.

Lyla did not object to his opinion, as it was intended to uncover the identity of the strange tree in the Violuwin Underground Ruins. Rather, it was in her favor.

Hans and Snock were the ones who thoroughly followed Zich's opinion, so they silently nodded their heads.

And Leona welcomed that she could take her friends home.

That's how we entered the Adrowon Great Forest.

On the first day, it was quite exciting. Although she had some knowledge of this kind of forest, it was only knowledge, not experience.

But it's a little bit weird. From the second day on, Lyla got tired of this huge forest.

The tree roots protruding out of the ground grabbed her ankles and necks, and a bush the size of a human being mercilessly struck her arms and face.

And the uneven terrain steadily gnawed at her stamina.

Due to Zich's training, Lyla had uncharacteristic stamina, but a wizard is a wizard. I was exhausted from the continuous march.

But she was the only one tired. Sieg and Hans, who have tremendous physical strength as swordsmen, did not even breathe harshly even on such a rough road.

Rather, Zich could even afford to help her as she continued to fall and fall. And Leona, an elf, only had a sore mouth to talk about.

Although Snock was most like her, he wasn't as panting as Lyla, though he wasn't as old in the party as Hans's, but had been thoroughly trained by Zich.

“Damn!”

This time, I slipped on the muddy part of the road because of the stagnant water. However, there was no need to throw clothes in the mud this time as Zich caught them.

“You are really slow.”

When Lyla opened her axe's eyes, Zich spread the distance like a hammer.

always a joke. However, Laila's eyes looking at Zich's back were complicated.

>'Until now, the usual Zich is correct.'

However, no matter how much I thought about it, the face I saw at that time in Violuwin's dorm did not leave.

>'  Did I see it wrong  ?'

But he shook his head.

>'I can't see that wrong.'

She is the one who always watches over Zich worrying that he will fall into the path of the Demon King. Because I knew for sure.

But she suppressed the rising anxiety.

>'Wait, the demon king's face just appeared. You said that you met Glen Zenard, so the Demon King's feelings may have risen.'

In fact, Zich was now behaving as usual.

>'So now without Glen Zenard, he won't suddenly turn into a Demon King.'

But the fact that she had a clue was terrifying. I can't remember all of them, but the pressure of the name Zich Moore was clearly visible in her.

>'Ah, damn it! Why is it now!' Isn't it a pain in the ass because of his identity? She couldn't afford to hug the new bomb named Zich Moore.

“Lyla, are you okay?”

Leona, who had already been by my side, asked. It seems that she ran a long way ahead of her on her way home and saw Lyla keep falling.

“Honestly, it’s a little difficult. not there yet?"

“I’m almost there. Walk a little further and you will see the village.”

Lyla nodded, hoping that 'a little' would really be a 'a little'. Fortunately, however, the 'a little bit' that Leona said was a common sense 'a little bit'.

After a short walk they found a village.

“Who are you?”

Five elves appeared on a large branch. Even on thick but round branches, it easily balances and directs arrows at them.

But despite such a menacing appearance, no one was holding a long chapter. The power of the party was too high to be frightened by just such a thing.

Conversely, in the eyes of the elves, they were very wary.

Humans who come to such a place are extremely rare. However, a person who broke their boundaries has appeared.

“Lower the bow.”

Leona said. The elves who confirmed her belatedly opened their eyes roundly. They did not know that there would be their kind among humans.

but one. The one who was leading the elf's vigilant group was startled in another sense.

"Princess!"

That was a word that would startle even Zich and the others.

♦ * *

Zich and his group were guided to the village. The village inhabited by hundreds of elves was built on a huge tree.

The house, built on a tree thick enough to hold ten people together, was very large and spacious.

It was completely different from the houses built on trees that humans think of.

Surprisingly, there were few trees in the village. The trees in the places where no houses were built seemed to have been uprooted and removed.

As if expanding the village, Snock muttered as he saw another tree being cut down at the end of the village.

“Didn’t elves love the forest?”

“It will be a little different from the image of humans.”

Lyla replied.

“It’s true that forests are treated more carefully than humans, but that’s because it benefits them to the end. The existence of the forest is closely related to the life of an elf. But conversely, it also means that they care for and care for the forest only for their survival. So it is common to improve forests to some extent for their own lives.”

" i See."

The elves in the house came out one by one to observe Zich and the others as strange humans were strange.

But there was little favor in their eyes. It wasn't even completely hostile.

severe borders. It was just that way.

Zich raised his head and looked at them. The elves who made eye contact with Zich shook their heads.

>'It is natural to be wary of strangers, but this is a bit harsh.'

I don't know if it's the elves who don't interact with humans at all, but it's said that the elves here do not interact with humans.

>'Is it because of the guys who stole the lake's tears?'

But even so, it was strange. If it is known that humans have caused direct damage, their gaze will be hostile, not borderline.

At that moment, the elf who was guiding the party stopped in front of a tree.

“We want our guests to stay here.”

Like other houses of the elves, the house where the party was guided was built as if it were hung from a tall tree.

The house, which seemed to be for guests, was a bit far from the other houses, but the facilities were sufficient. The rooms were also spacious, so one room per person could be used.

Lyla greeted the guide elf.

"Thank you."

"no. I am rather sorry that I could only treat the princess like this to her party.”

"it's okay. Because my companions are good.”

Leona groaned. The guide elf smiled slightly. But he soon changed his expression and spoke in a serious tone.

"I'm really sorry, but please refrain from going out."

"uh? Why?"

Leona asked surprised. But Laila stopped her.

"okay. Can you tell me how long I have to be here?”

It seems that she also sensed the subtle atmosphere in the village.

Fortunately, the conversation seemed to make sense, and the guide elf seemed to be relieved.

“Someone else will come in the evening and explain in detail. then."

The guide elf said goodbye again and left the house.

Leona was still perplexed, not knowing English. Then Zich tapped her.

“Don’t panic too much. There seems to be something going on in town.”

“Work?”

"okay. The boundaries of the elves are no joke.”

Leona recalled the reactions of her people.

I was so excited to be able to introduce my hometown to my friends and the joy of getting back the stolen 'Tears of the Lake', but when I think about it again, it was definitely something strange.

“I’m going out for a second!”

Zich caught Leona as she was about to leave the house.

“What are you going to do?”

“Hey, you should know what happened! I am the princess of this forest!”

“Arthur.”

Zich shook his head.

“If you gossip right now, there is a high possibility that the anxiety of the other elves will only increase. It is better to wait for someone to come in the evening.”

“O uh”

—"o'.

I wanted to go out and ask the people right away, but Leona meekly nodded.

So far, listening to Zich's words and not having failed experiences occupied a large share.

"okay."

“Then let’s relax each other and see you in the evening.”

“I’m going to sleep.”

After entering the forest, Lyla, who suffered the most, immediately decided on a room and entered.

Leonard also took a glance at the front door of the house and picked his own room.

“You also go in.”

Zich spoke to the remaining Hans and Snock. However, the two seemed to want to say something with all their might.

“Are you surprised that Leona is a princess?”

“Yeah, that’s a surprise!”

Snock said. Hans nodded quietly next to him.

The friend you've traveled with so far was an elf princess.

“No surprise. An elven king is different from a human king. Although he rules over the elves, he is only a representative figure to the end. Even if you are treated a little more than others, you do not wield enormous power like a human. Therefore, the treatment of Leona is different from that of a princess in the human kingdom.”

If the princess of the human kingdom even entered a village like this, the villagers would not react as plainly as the current elves.

But Hans and Snock didn't seem to understand. They deservedly because it was a completely different system from the world they lived in.

“I don’t need to understand. Just do it all and pass it on. Leona just treats her the way she is now.”

Leaving behind those words, Zich also chose his own room and disappeared.

The rest of Hans and Snock looked at each other. I just think it is and pass it on. But it was also true that they had no other option.

Even though the two did not escape the shock, they forcibly engraved Dozek's words into their heads and decided to enter their own room.
